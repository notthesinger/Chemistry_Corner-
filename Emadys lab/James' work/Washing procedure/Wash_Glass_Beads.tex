\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to standardize the washing procedure for glass beads used in hopper flow test experiments at the Particulate Process and Product Design lab at ASU. The first goal of the washing procedure is to treat the glass beads with an anti static solution to prevent the glass beads from getting tribocharged which causes the beads to adhere to the walls of the hopper \cite{Chen2017}. The second goal of the washing procedure it to rid the glass beads of dust and particulate that may accumulate as  as a result using the glass beads in the hopper flow tests.

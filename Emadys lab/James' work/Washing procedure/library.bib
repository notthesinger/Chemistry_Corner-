abstract = {Fluidization is sensitive to mild cohesion levels, as evidenced by the different flow behaviors of Geldart Group A and Group B particles. Additionally, cohesion is extremely sensitive to surface roughness. Here, mildly cohesive (Group A) spherical particles were carefully characterized and used in high-fidelity experiments of defluidization, bed expansion, and bubble characterization. The experiments were conducted such that van der Waals forces were the only source of cohesion, and thus the results presented can be used for validating Discrete Element Method (DEM) and/or continuum models. Particle characterization includes surface roughness and adhesion (pull-off) force, which can be used for modeling the van der Waals force. Additionally, the particle friction coefficient, coefficient of restitution, shape (sphericity), and diameter were measured via a suite of simple experiments. This level of particle characterization, which is critical for the validation of cohesive models (DEM and continuum), has not been reported in previous fluidization studies. Accordingly, the characterization experiments employed here are described in sufficient detail for straightforward adaption elsewhere.},

abstract = {Multiphase flows are ubiquitous in many industrial processes. The inherent coupling of different phases poses many unique challenges in predicting and effectively controlling these processes. Hence, computational modeling and simulation offers a viable approach to overcome these challenges. In this study, we present recent development efforts for enhancing the physical modeling capabilities of an open-source computational modeling tool for real life industrial multiphase processes by enabling particle-size polydispersity and demonstrating with an associated validation study. The proposed implementation was performed in MFIX open-source framework due to its unique feature of tightly integrated computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method solvers for simulating coupled continuum fluid and granular flows. We have implemented the polydispersity feature in a minimally invasive way and provided means to allow easy specification of an arbitrary particle size distribution function, which also enables the user to easily handle an arbitrary number of solid phases, each possessing a distinct arbitrary particle-size distribution. To establish the credibility of improvements, we have carried out a preliminary verification and validation (V{\&}V) study for the polydispersity feature by employing a hopper bin discharge problem, which is frequently encountered in industrial applications. Specifically, two types of micro-glass beads with distinct size distributions are used to fill the hopper in two possible packing arrangements, i.e., well-mixed and layered configurations, with varying mass (particle number) ratios. The experimentally obtained discharge dynamics (e.g., normalized discharge mass fraction for one of the phases versus the overall discharge mass fraction) for different systems is found to be in excellent agreement with the corresponding simulation results.},

abstract = {A kinetic model for sophorolipid production by Candida bombicola is proposed. The unstructured nonsegregated kinetic model takes into account three responses: biomass, sugar, and sophorolipid. In the kinetic model, the nitrogen-from yeast extract-is assumed to be the limiting nutrient of the yeast growth, the sugar-glucose-is assumed to be used in both growth and sophorolipid production, and oil is supposed to be spent in product formation and maintenance of biomass is attributed to glycerol eased by the catabolism of the oil. The parameters of the kinetic model are calculated by fitting model to experimental data. These data have been obtained in experiments in which a batch stirred and an aerated tank bioreactor have been used. Fitting has been carried out according to a nonlinear regression algorithm, coupled with a Runge-Kutta method for the interpretation of integral data (evolution of system composition with time). The proposed kinetic model is able to explain both our experimental data and data given by other authors in previous works in literature in which nutrient and product concentrations evolution are given.

abstract = {The yeast Starmerella bombicola secretes sophorolipids, a family of biosurfactants that find applications in green household products and cosmetics. Over the past years, a gene cluster was discovered that is responsible for the entire synthesis of the open (acidic) form of these molecules from glucose, fatty acids and acetyl-CoA building blocks. However, a significant fraction of the natural product is obtained as a ring closed form (lactonic). Both genetic and proteomic approaches hitherto failed to discover an enzyme responsible for the esterification reaction required for the ring closure step. We hypothesized that this enzyme is extracellularly secreted. Therefore, we characterized the composition of the S. bombicola exoproteome at different time points of the growth and compared it with known yeast exoproteomes. We identified 44 proteins, many of them commonly found in other fungi. Curiously, we discovered an enzyme with homology to Pseudozyma antarctica lipase A. A deletion mutation of its gene resulted in complete abolishment of the sophorolipid lactonization providing evidence that this might be the missing enzyme in the sophorolipid biosynthetic pathway. Biological significance: Growing concern about the impact of chemical processes on the environment increases consumers' demand for bio-based products. Lately, the household care and personal care sectors show increasing interest in naturally occurring biosurfactants, which constitute environment-friendly alternatives for chemical surfactants, typically derived from mineral oils. A particular group of biosurfactants, sophorolipids, already found their way to the market, being used in a range of household detergent products and in cosmetics. This work describes how proteomic approaches have led to the completion of our knowledge on the biosynthetic pathway of sophorolipids as performed by Starmerella bombicola, a fungus used in the industrial production of these biosurfactants. Moreover, we proved that by creating a deletion mutant in the lactone esterase discovered in this study, we can shape the biosynthesis towards custom-made sophorolipids with desired functions. Herewith, we demonstrate the potential of proteomics in industrial biotechnology. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Single drop impact of liquid on a static powder bed was studied to investigate the granule formation mechanism, droplet penetration time, as well as the characterization of granules (morphology, surface structure and internal structure). Water was used as the liquid and two pharmaceutical powders, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and acetaminophen (APAP), were mixed to make heterogeneous powder beds. The complete drop impact and penetration was recorded by a high speed camera. Two granule formation mechanisms that have been identified previously occurred: Spreading and Tunneling. Spreading occurred for mixtures with an APAP amount of less than 20{\%}, while Tunneling started to occur when the APAP amount increased above 20{\%}. With an increase of APAP concentration, the mean particle size decreased, drop penetration time increased, and the granules formed became smaller in size, which was in good agreement with previous literature. The granule morphology, surface structure, and internal structure were characterized by a prism method with image analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray microtomography, respectively. The Spreading mechanism produced flat disks with a porous internal structure, while the Tunneling mechanism produced round granules with a dense internal structure. There is a clear trend of decreasing porosity and increasing roundness of granules made from heterogeneous mixtures within the transition from Spreading to Tunneling. It is believed that the mean particle size of the powder bed and the powder-liquid contact angle are the predominant factors in influencing the formation mechanism, drop penetration time, and granule properties.},

The engineering methods for producing a single crystal are broadly classified into two types: the Czochralski (CZ) method and the Floating Zone (FZ) method. Both involve careful solidification of molten silicon, which has been previously made from heated polycrystalline silicon. A round rod or square pillar of single crystal silicon, called a seed crystal, is prepared. This is brought down into the molten silicon and, soon after it touches the surface, the interface instantly solidifies. The molten silicon that is contacted solidifies as a single crystal. Current wire saws can cut up to four ingots simultaneously from four sides of the web; a vast improvement in productivity over the inner diameter (ID) saw. Since the wire is so thin, the kerf loss in the wire saw cutting process is minimal.},

Sophorolipid production by Candida bombicola was studied as a model for fat utilization for biosurfactant production. Inoculum medium components (glucose, animal fat, ammonium sulfate, corn steep liquor, urea and potassium phosphate) were optimized for rapid growth. Similar components were chosen to design a production medium for sophorolipid production. Corn steep liquor provided vitamins and minerals, and fat plus glucose were used as carbon sources. Maximum growth was obtained at 30??C but greater sophorolipid production occurred at 27??C. In a pH-controlled fermenter (maintained at pH 3??4 after the first 24 hours) 120 g l-1 of sophorolipid was obtained in 68 h. Silica gel column chromatography of the extracted sophorolipid revealed the presence of at least six components, including a major component comprising 45{\%} of the total sophorolipids. Cells at the end of fermentation contained 37{\%} protein and 14{\%} lipids. Amino acid analysis indicated a high quality of protein, although with a lower than desired tryptophan level. A reduction in production time with high volumetric productivity and inexpensive raw materials make sophorolipid competitive against surfactants used in the food and cosmetics industries. ?? 1996.},

abstract = {Sophorolipids are carbohydrate-based, amphiphilic biosurfactants produced by several species of the Starmerella yeast clade. Most sophorolipids are partially acetylated sophorose sugars O-$\beta$-glycosidically linked to 17-L-hydroxy-$\delta$9-octadecenoic acid, where typically the acyl carboxyl group forms a 4″-lactone to the terminal glucosyl residue. Recently sophorolipids were discovered in which the sophorose is linked to the $\omega$-carbon of the acyl group and occurs predominately in a non-lactone, anionic form. In this study we compared lactone sophorolipids produced by Starmerella (Candida) bombicola (Sb) and non-lactone sophorolipids produced by Candida kuoi (Ck) against a synthetic polyethoxylated tallowamine surfactant (POEA) which is used in commercial postemergence herbicides. When mixed with the lipophilic contact herbicide lemongrass oil (LGO), stable emulsions with Ck lasted longer than with either POEA or Sb. Phytotoxicity (as measured by fresh and dry weights and visual damage three days after spraying) to sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia) by the Ck/LGO and Sb/LGO mixtures were similar to a POEA/LGO mixture, while visual damage to corn (Zea mays L.) was increased by the addition of all of the surfactants. When applied together with the water-soluble herbicide phosphinothricin, the Ck/LGO and Sb/LGO treatments caused decreases in sicklepod dry weights and herbicide damage ratings (HDR) compared to phosphinothricin applied without a surfactant ten days after treatment. With corn, POEA and Ck applied with PT had the greatest reductions in fresh and dry weights, and HDR values. These results indicate that sophorolipids have excellent promise as natural surfactants for postemergence herbicides. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

Vinyl caprate was mechanically dispersed into a solution of sucrose in DMSO. The use of DMSO allowed increasing sucrose concentration up to 0.7 M (in DMSO). The denaturing effect of DMSO on lipase was avoided by pretreatment of lipase by pH adjustment in the presence of crown ether. This pretreatment maintained a significant catalytic activity which led to 0.2 M sucrose monoester within 1 h at 50 °C, which represented higher productivity than already reported. Detailed structural characterization revealed that only monoester was recovered and the 2-O-acylated sucrose monocaprate was the major isomer in the final product.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lignocellulose should undergo pretreatment to enhance its enzymatic digestibility before being saccharified. Peracetic acid (PAA) is a strong oxidant that can remove lignin under mild conditions. The sulfuric acid in the PAA solution also can cause degradation of hemicelluloses. The objective of the present work is to investigate the effect of several factors on peracetic acid pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse. RESULTS: It was found that PAA charge, liquid/solid (l/s) ratio, temperature, time, interactions between PAA charge and l/s ratio, temperature and time, all had a very significant effect on the enzymatic conversion ratio of cellulose. The relative optimum condition was obtained as follows: PAA charge 50{\%}, l/s ratio 6:1, temperature 80°C and time 2 h. More than 80{\%} of the cellulose in bagasse treated under the above conditions was converted to glucose by cellulase of 20 FPUg-1 cellulose. Compared with H2SO4 and NaOH pretreatments under the same mild conditions, PAA pretreatment was the most effective for enhancement of enzymatic digestibility. CONCLUSION: PAA pretreatment could greatly enhance the enzymatic digestibility of sugarcane bagasse by removing hemicelluloses and lignin, but removal of lignin was more helpful. This study can serve as a step to further optimization of PAA pretreatment and understanding the mechanism of enhancement of enzymatic digestibility.},

All alkyl $\beta$-d-xylopyranosides formed thermotropic liquid crystals. The phase transition of the solid crystalline phase to a liquid crystalline phase increased linearly with the length of the hydrophobic tail. The clearing points were near constant for alkyl $\beta$-d-xylopyranosides with a hydrophobic tail ≥8, but occurred at a significantly lower temperature for hexyl $\beta$-d-xylopyranoside. Short and long-chain alkyl $\beta$-d- xylopyranosides displayed no cytotoxicity at concentration below their aqueous solubility limit.

Reactions were performed in monophasic (butanol phase) and biphasic systems (emulsified aqueous in butanol phase). The results indicated that water content was an essential parameter of this reaction. In the case of the monophasic system, addition of water led to a significant increase of product concentration. The highest concentration was obtained at 17{\%} (v/v) of water. Conversely, in the case of the biphasic system, increasing the aqueous/butanol phase ratio (v/v) provoked a decrease of the final butylgalactoside concentration. In this system, the reaction performance was lower than that in the monophasic system. Lactose favorably influenced the reaction synthesis.

These so-called biosurfactants offer an environmental friendly alternative for the petrochemical derived surfactants used in various sectors and attract quite some industrial attention due to the high yields of over 400 g/L which can be obtained by cultivations with Candida bombicola. On top of their surface lowering properties, sophorolipids display several interesting biological activities, allowing applications in the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and medical field. In this review, various aspects of the sophorolipid production process are outlined as well as recent findings on the biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, the synthesis of modified sophorolipids derived either microbial or by post-fermentative modification is discussed.

abstract = {Lipases are a group of enzymes naturally endowed with the property of performing reactions in aqueous as well as organic solvents. The esterification reactions using lipase(s) could be performed in water-restricted organic media as organic solvent(s) not only improve(s) the solubility of substrate and reactant in reaction mixture but also permit(s) the reaction in the reverse direction, and often it is easy to recover the product in organic phase in two-phase equilibrium systems. The use of organic solvent tolerant lipase in organic media has exhibited many advantages: increased activity and stability, regiospecificity and stereoselectivity, higher solubility of substrate, ease of products recovery, and ability to shift the reaction equilibrium toward synthetic direction. Therefore the search for organic solvent tolerant enzymes has been an extensive area of research. A variety of fatty acid esters are now being produced commercially using immobilized lipase in nonaqueous solvents. This review describes the organic tolerance and industrial application of lipases. The main emphasis is to study the nature of organic solvent tolerant lipases. Also, the potential industrial applications that make lipases the biocatalysts of choice for the present and future have been presented.},

Their antiviral and antitumor effects enable their use in pharmaceutic as therapeutic agents. Also, glycolipids can inhibit the bioadhesion of pathogenic bacteria enabling their use as anti-adhesive agents and for disruption of biofilm formation and can be used in cosmetic industry. Moreover, they have great potential application in industry as detergents, wetting agents and for flotation. Furthermore, glycolipids can act at the surface and can modulate enzyme activity permitting the enhancement or the inhibition of the activity of certain enzymes.},

Growth-inhibition activity of the SL-biopolymers against Propionibacterium acnes, a causative agent of acne vulgaris skin condition, is dependent on the SL contents of the films; the degree of inhibition as determined from the width of the zone of inhibition in agar-plate assays follows the order of SL-PCL{\textgreater}SL-PLLA{\textgreater}SL-PHB. The release of SL from the films into aqueous medium after a 4-d shaking at 25°C showed that SL-PLLA (30.1±1.7wt{\%} SL released) most readily released the embedded SL, followed by SL-PHB (11.4±4.3wt{\%}) and SL-PCL (4.3±1.4wt{\%}). Thermal properties as determined by differential scanning calorimetry showed that SL decreases the heat of fusion ($\delta$H) and the melting temperature (Tm) of the biopolymers, indicating for the first time its usefulness as a plasticizer to prevent crystallization. In summary, the study shows the feasibility of controlling the release of antimicrobial SL by varying the type of biopolymer used, with the added advantage of SL functioning as a plasticizer to improve the physical properties of the film in term of lower crystallinity. Future research could benefit the agricultural sector via new developments as varied as antimicrobial food packaging and algal bloom mitigation.},

Our aim was to select the lipase with the highest catalytic efficiency as a biocatalyst to efficiently produce trehalose ester derivatives with the lowest production cost for further industrial applications. The highest conversion yields of trehalose lipoate (75.9 ± 1.9{\%}) were obtained at the following optimal conditions: reaction temperature 40 °C, reaction time 4 days, substrate molar ratio 1:4 (trehalose:lipoic acid), total enzyme activity 3000 PLU (propyl laurate units), four stepwise additions of lipoic acid (0.03 mmol/day) and a cosolvent ratio of 4:1 [DMSO:2-methyl-2-butanol(2M2B)]. After isolation and purification, the carboxyl group of lipoic acid was determined to be connected to the C6 hydroxyl group of trehalose using nuclear magnetic resonance. The DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical-scavenging activity ({\%}) of purified 6-o-trehalose lipoate was at least 2.5-fold higher than that of lipoic acid. This bioactive trehalose ester exhibits improved antioxidant activity, which may have higher health benefits than those of lipoic acid, in various functional product applications.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses sucrose chemistry and the applications of sucrochemicals. The use of sucrose as a chemical raw material was first motivated by the desire to increase the small proportion of the total production dedicated to the applications of higher value, essentially for nonfood uses. The conformational structure of sucrose is essentially based on the intramolecular hydrogen-bond network that connects hydroxyl groups from the glucose and the fructose moieties. Some scales of relative acidity of the hydroxyl groups of sucrose, converging on the highest acidity for OH-2, can be established either by semi-empirical calculations or be deduced from the distribution of the regio-isomers after selective substitution. It is found that because of the high stability of the ether function, etherification of unprotected sucrose leads to a kinetic distribution of products directly reflecting the relative reactivity of the hydroxyl groups. Specific microorganisms, yeasts, and bacteria can also convert sucrose into other alcohols, as well as organic acids, amino acids, and vitamins. All these biological processes have been improved with the help of modern biotechnology, making them more chemically and economically efficient and to direct them toward new and useful chemical products.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A commercial lipase, “Lipolase T100”, was immobilised onto silica by means of physical adsorption. The silica-bound lipase was subsequently exposed to 1 vol. {\%} glutaraldehyde (pentane-1,5-dial). The silica was loaded repeatedly with the Lipolase T100 in 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 8.5) until saturation was achieved. During the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th cycles of loading of silica with the enzyme, the protein-binding on the silica achieved 51.73 {\%}, 48.27 {\%}, 26.92 {\%}, 10.73 {\%}, and 4.29 {\%}, respectively. The synthesis of methyl salicylate (methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate) and linalyl ferulate (3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-yl 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamate) carried out at 45°C under shaking with mole ratios of 200 mM of acid and 500 mM alcohol in DMSO using 15 mg mL−1 of hyper-activated biocatalyst resulted in yield(s) of 77.2 {\%} of methyl salicylate and 65.3 {\%} of linalyl ferulate in the presence of molecular sieves. The hyper-activated biocatalyst was more efficient than the previously reported silica-bound lipase with minimum leaching of the enzyme from the reaction mixture. The K m and V max of the free (0.142 mM and 38.31 $\mu$mol min−1 mL−1, respectively) and silica-bound lipase (0.043 mM and 26.32 $\mu$mol min−1 mg−1, respectively) were determined for the hydrolysis of p-NPP. During repeated esterification studies using silica-bound lipase, yields of 50.1 {\%} of methyl salicylate after the 5th cycle, and 53.9 {\%} of linalyl ferulate after the 7th cycle of esterification were recorded. In the presence of molecular sieves (30 mg mL−1) in the reaction mixture, the maximum syntheses of methyl salicylate (77.2 {\%}) and linalyl ferulate (65.3 {\%}) were also observed. In a volumetric batch scale-up, when the reaction volume was increased to 50 mL, 44.9 {\%} and 31.4 {\%} yields of methyl salicylate and linalyl ferulate, respectively, were achieved.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activities of sugar fatty acid esters, with different fatty acid and saccharide moieties, against five food-related bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Sucrose monocaprate showed the strongest antibacterial activity against all tested bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 2.5 and 10 mM, respectively. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for Gram-positive bacteria were 10 mM. Time-kill assay also showed that sucrose monocaprate significantly inhibit the growth of tested bacteria. The permeability of the cell membrane and intracellular proteins were both changed by sucrose monocaprate according to cell constituents' leakage, SDS-PAGE and scanning electron microscope assays. It is suggested that sucrose monocaprate, with both emulsifying and antibacterial activities, have a potential to serve as a safe multifunctional food additive in food industries.},

abstract = {Enzymatic syntheses of oligosaccharide fatty acid esters are important owing to their wide range of industrial applications in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Transesterification of isomaltotriose and palmitic acid vinyl ester, catalyzed by the metalloprotease thermolysin, was performed in organic solvents. The process parameters (reaction time and temperature) were optimized to achieve the highest yield of isomaltotriose palmitate (IP). The water content of the reaction system played a key role in the acylation of isomaltotriose. Dimethyl sulfoxide was thought to be the most suitable reaction medium by taking the degree of substitution of the modified isomaltotriose into account. The optimum reaction time, temperature, water content, and enzyme concentration were 24 h, 45 °C, 40{\%}, and 0.05{\%}, respectively, under which the product yield was as high as 89.7{\%}. The enzyme operational stability study showed that thermolysin retained 51.5{\%} of its initial activity for the synthesis of IP (even after repeated use for 72 h). Moreover, test results showed that the emulsifying capacity and emulsion stability of IP are 107.5 mL oil/g ester and 16.3{\%}, respectively.},

The chemical composition of the hemicelluloses, such as ash content or the level of arabinose and uronic acids in the polysaccharides structures, seems to influence the reactivity. The use of dimethylsulfoxide as solvent in the transglycosidation improved pentosides and glucosides yields for beechwood xylan, the more recalcitrant material. The surfactant properties of glycosides' compositions produced from poplar were studied and compared to those of glycosides' compositions obtained from pure monomeric carbohydrates or from wheat straw.

The in vitro release test showed variation in the extent of percent drug released. The drug release from the commercial preparation was lower than some of the prepared emulgel formulae. One formula containing combination of the two gelling agents (HPMC and Carbopol 934 P), showed excellent stability and high extent of clotrimazole release was microbiologically evaluated against Candida albicans using cylinder and plate method. The selected formula showed superior antimycotic activity compared to the commercially available formulation. Further in vivo animal studies for the obtained stable formula is recommended.},

The results show that the variation amplitude of tangent $\Phi$Ris linear with the related particle physical properties (density, particle size and secondary particle mass fraction). It is shown that the most important parameters determining the mixed granular system angle of repose are density variation and surface roughness for the similar particle size. In addition, whether the particle size of base particle material or secondary particle varies or not, the linear relationship always exists.

The method performance was assessed and compared with other solventless technique, the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) in headspace mode (HS). For both techniques, influential experimental parameters were optimised to provide sensitive and robust methods. The SBSE-LD/LVI methodology was previously optimised in terms of extraction time, influence of ethanol in the matrix, liquid desorption (LD) conditions and instrumental settings. Higher extraction efficiency was obtained using 60 min of extraction time, 10{\%} ethanol content, n-pentane as desorption solvent, 15 min for the back-extraction period, 10 mL min-1for the solvent vent flow rate and 10 °C for the inlet temperature. For HS-SPME, the fibre coated with 50/30 $\mu$m divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) afforded highest extraction efficiency, providing the best sensitivity for the target volatiles, particularly when the samples were extracted at 25 °C for 60 min under continuous stirring in the presence of sodium chloride (10{\%} (w/v)). Both methodologies showed good linearity over the concentration range tested, with correlation coefficients higher than 0.984 for HS-SPME and 0.982 for SBES-LD approach, for all analytes. A good reproducibility was attained and low detection limits were achieved using both SBSE-LD (0.03-28.96 $\mu$g L-1) and HS-SPME (0.02-20.29 $\mu$g L-1) methodologies. The quantification limits for SBSE-LD approach ranging from 0.11 to 96.56 $\mu$g L-and from 0.06 to 67.63 $\mu$g L-1for HS-SPME. Using the HS-SPME approach an average recovery of about 70{\%} was obtained whilst by using SBSE-LD obtained average recovery were close to 80{\%}. The analytical and procedural advantages and disadvantages of these two methods have been compared. Both analytical methods were used to determine the HAA, IsoE and EE fatty acids content in "Terras Madeirenses" table wines. A total of 16 esters were identified and quantified from the wine extracts by HS-SPME whereas by SBSE-LD technique were found 25 esters which include 2 higher alcohol acetates, 4 isoamyl esters and 19 ethyl esters of fatty acids. Generally SBSE-LD provided higher sensitivity with decreased analysis time. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {New Lewis acid AlTf-UVM-7 catalysts with bimodal pore system and different Si to Al ratios were prepared in a two-step synthesis in which triflic acid (Tf) was incorporated into previously synthesized mesoporous aluminum-containing silica. The Al incorporation inside the pore walls was carried out through the Atrane method. The characterization of the resulted catalysts showed that the triflic acid treatment step did not damage the texture or the structure of the catalysts. These materials were used as green catalysts for the etherification of fatty alcohols and the conversion of ethylene glycol (EG) with n-octanol resulting in mixtures of short ethoxylated structures with a large distribution of C8E1-C8E3 products. The process occurred with high conversions of ethylene glycol and high selectivities to ethoxylated products. Recyclable experiments showed the catalysts are stable and the reuse occurred without changes in the chemical composition. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Enzymatic synthesis of fatty acid esters of di- and trisaccharides is limited by the fact that most biological catalysts are inactivated by the polar solvents (e.g. dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide) where these carbohydrates are soluble. This article reviews the methodologies developed to overcome this limitation, namely those involving control over the reaction medium, the enzyme and the support. We have proposed the use of mixtures of miscible solvents (e.g. dimethylsulfoxide and 2-methyl-2-butanol) as a general strategy to acylate enzymatically hydrophilic substrates. We observed that decreasing the hydrophobicity of the medium (i.e. lowering the percentage of DMSO) the molar ratio sucrose diesters versus sucrose monoesters can be substantially enhanced. The different regioselectivity exhibited by several lipases and proteases makes feasible to synthesise different positional isomers, whose properties may vary considerably. In particular, the lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus displays a notable selectivity for only one hydroxyl group in the acylation of sucrose, maltose, leucrose and maltotriose, compared with lipase from Candida antarctica. We have examined three immobilisation methods (adsorption on polypropylene, covalent coupling to Eupergit C, and silica-granulation) for sucrose acylation catalysed by T. lanuginosus lipase. The morphology of the support affected significantly the reaction rate and/or the selectivity of the process. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

A homologous series including 17 examples of alkyl $\alpha$-l-rhamnoside amphiphiles varying in chain structure (C4-C20) is reported. The structures of the new derivatives were determined by NMR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.

The denaturing effect of DMSO on lipase was avoided by pretreatment of lipase by pH adjustment in the presence of crown ether. This pretreatment maintained a significant catalytic activity which led to 0.2 M sucrose monoester within 1 h at 50 °C, which represented higher productivity than already reported. Detailed structural characterization revealed that only monoester was recovered and the 2-O-acylated sucrose monocaprate was the major isomer in the final product.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to construct an environmentally and eco-friendly production process of a bio-based surfactant, namely a sugar fatty acid ester (SE), using a heterogeneous catalyst. A strongly basic resin was found to show a fairly high catalytic activity in the transesterification of sucrose and a fatty acid methyl ester to produce an SE under mild conditions, i.e., 60 °C and atmospheric pressure, especially when sufficient sucrose was adsorbed on the resin active sites. In a continuous process using a flow reactor packed with the resin, an appropriate combination of sucrose adsorption and sucrose supply during the reaction enabled to maintain the sucrose concentration at high levels. As a result, continuous SE production succeeded in a short residence time of 1.5 h without saponification to form soap for the first time. In this process, the downstream operations to separate the soap and the catalyst from the product were unnecessary. This heterogeneous resin catalyst enables simple, efficient, and environmentally friendly SE production and this process has potential commercial applications.},

abstract = {Multiphase flows are ubiquitous in many industrial processes. The inherent coupling of different phases poses many unique challenges in predicting and effectively controlling these processes. Hence, computational modeling and simulation offers a viable approach to overcome these challenges. In this study, we present recent development efforts for enhancing the physical modeling capabilities of an open-source computational modeling tool for real life industrial multiphase processes by enabling particle-size polydispersity and demonstrating with an associated validation study. The proposed implementation was performed in MFIX open-source framework due to its unique feature of tightly integrated computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method solvers for simulating coupled continuum fluid and granular flows. We have implemented the polydispersity feature in a minimally invasive way and provided means to allow easy specification of an arbitrary particle size distribution function, which also enables the user to easily handle an arbitrary number of solid phases, each possessing a distinct arbitrary particle-size distribution. To establish the credibility of improvements, we have carried out a preliminary verification and validation (V{\&}V) study for the polydispersity feature by employing a hopper bin discharge problem, which is frequently encountered in industrial applications. Specifically, two types of micro-glass beads with distinct size distributions are used to fill the hopper in two possible packing arrangements, i.e., well-mixed and layered configurations, with varying mass (particle number) ratios. The experimentally obtained discharge dynamics (e.g., normalized discharge mass fraction for one of the phases versus the overall discharge mass fraction) for different systems is found to be in excellent agreement with the corresponding simulation results.},

abstract = {Culturing Pseudozyma aphidis on glucose as main carbon source and soybean oil as co-substrate the mannosylerythritol lipids MEL-A and MEL-B were produced. Based on their excellent surface/interfacial active behavior they possess a high potential among all known biosurfactants. The components of a microbial MEL mixture were purified by medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) and were used as substrates for in vitro enzymatic modifications. Lipase-catalyzed acylations of MEL-A and MEL-B with uncommon fatty acids from other microbial glycolipids - 3-hydroxydecanoic acid from rhamnolipids and 17- hydroxyoctadecanoic acid from classical sophorolipids - yielded functionalized products at the C-1 position of the erythritol. The novel products were purified by MPLC and their structures elucidated by1H and13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. In physicochemical characterization experiments two of the three new glycoconjugates lowered the surface tension of water from 72 mN m-1to 27-38 mN m-1. Moreover the novel compounds inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria and showed a potential for anti-tumor-promoting activity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, disaccharide phosphorylases have received increasing attention as promising bio- catalysts for glycoside synthesis. Unfortunately, these enzymes typically have a very low affinity for non- carbohydrate acceptors, which urges the addition of cosolvents to increase the dissolved concentration of these acceptors. However, commonly applied solvents such as methanol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are not compatible with many intended applications of carbohydrate-derived products. In this work, the solubility of a wide range of relevant acceptors was assessed in the presence of ionic liquids (ILs) as alternative and ‘green' solvents. The IL AMMOENG 101 was found to be the most effective co- solvent for compounds as diverse as medium- and long-chain alcohols, flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolics and terpenes. Moreover, this IL was shown to be less deleterious to the stability and activity of sucrose phosphorylase than the commonly used dimethyl sulfoxide. To demonstrate the usefulness of this solvent system, a process for the resveratrol glycosylation was established in a buffer containing 20{\%} AMMOENG 101, 1Msucrose and saturated amounts of the acceptor. A single regioisomer 3-O-$\alpha$-D-gluco- pyranosyl-(E)-resveratrol was obtained as proven by NMR spectroscopy},

Sugar esters are widely used nonionic and nontoxic biosurfactants. Certain sugar esters inhibit microbial growth and have other activities. Lipase mediated synthesis has important advantages over conventional chemical synthesis of sugar esters. Lipase catalyzed synthesis is typically carried out in organic solvents having a low water activity to drive the reaction towards synthesis instead of towards ester hydrolysis. The impact of the various reaction conditions on enzymatic synthesis of sugar esters in nonaqueous media is discussed. Considered in particular are the solvent effects; the effects of water activity; the influence of the nature and concentration of the reactants (sugars and fatty acids); the influence of temperature; and the effects associated with the specific nature of the lipase catalyst used. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a novel Aspergillus Niger whole-cell biocatalyst with excellent operational stability was constructed using a heterologous anchor protein, and the details about its practical catalytic characteristics during the synthesis of green biosolvent isopropyl esters (IPEs) were investigated. Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) was chosen as a model enzyme, fused to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycosylphosphatidylinositol protein, SED1, and displayed on the A. Niger surface, the hydrolytic activity of the A. Niger mycelium-surface displayed CALB reached 440.30 U/g dry cell. In solvent-free esterifications of medium-long chain fatty acids and isopropanol, the A. Niger/CALB-Flag-SED1 whole-cell biocatalyst showed great organic substrate tolerance, high thermostability, no significant lag time in a dry initial condition and no synthetic activity decrease after five batch reactions at 65 °C. The highest yields of isopropyl laurate, isopropyl myristate, and isopropyl palmitate, 79.21, 81.62, and 81.41{\%}, respectively, were obtained after a 6-h reaction. Acetone washing helped to remove the excessive water accumulating during esterification and benefitted the operational stability. The relative acid conversions of the three IPEs in batch 5 were 99.79, 99.10, and 96.83{\%}, respectively, of those in batch 1. The A. Niger/CALB-Flag-SED1 whole-cell biocatalyst is a promising alternative to commercial immobilized products, and SED1 can serve as an efficient anchor module to display industrial enzymes in an A.

In this second part, current‐voltage curves and etch rate results derived from the loss of material and performed with n‐type Si samples of various orientations, show that electrochemical and chemical reactions coexist in the oxidation of Si. A model is presented for the oxidation of a Si atom in a kink site in different situations of polarization. The key feature of the description is the understanding of the persistent hydrogen termination of the surface in spite of the continuous oxidative removal of Si atoms from the surface. The model includes the hydrolytic splitting of Si—H and Si—Si bonds as the important chemical contributions to the etching process. At the rest potential, the chemical component is dominant. The sequence of reactions leaves the surface in the Formula terminated state. The anodic current is due to the injection of electrons which are produced during the substitution of Si—H by Si—OH bonds. This results above a critical electrode potential in passivation. In this respect, (111) and (100) faces present quite different behaviors. At cathodic bias where the hydrogen evolution becomes fast, due to the accumulation of electrons at the surface, not only the anodic component of the etching reaction vanishes but also the chemical component decreases in rate and is eventually stopped.},

abstract = {superhydrophobic surfaces can be used to reduce the minimum voltage and to increase the maximum speed under certain conditions, but there are some harmful side-effects. First of all, the electrostatic pressure can push water into the surface pores, which hinders actuation. The phenomenon can also be treated as a vertical electrowetting effect. Another drawback is that the use of superhydrophobic surfaces makes actuation more critical to the properties of the liquid. For example, actuation of biological buffer solutions was not successful. For these reasons, it is concluded that it is more beneficial to use a smooth surface with low hysteresis than a superhydrophobic surface in droplet actuation. Electrostatic droplet actuation is a potential method for manipulating liquid on a microscopic scale, but there is still work to do. This work contains a detailed examination of the droplet actuation mechanism, and trapping of charges in the solid-liquid interface is found to be the most severe problem that needs to be solved.},

The bulk and tapped densities decreased from 690.71 to 622.71 kg/m3and 819.10 to 729.31 kg/m3, respectively as moisture content increased from 3 to 9{\%} (d.b.). Cohesiveness, expressed in terms of Hausner ratio and Carr index, increased with increase in moisture content. The sticky point temperature also decreased from about 40 °C at 2{\%} moisture content to 10 °C at 8{\%} moisture content, suggesting that the product was very much susceptible to caking. The basic flow energy values increased from 783.39 kPa at 3{\%} moisture content to 1883.2 kPa at 9{\%} moisture content. Shear tests showed that basundi mix was relatively more flowable at 3{\%} (or less moisture content) than at 9{\%} moisture content. It could be concluded that dynamic flow tests were better in characterizing flowability of basundi mix than static flow indicators such as angle of repose and Hausner ratio. Overall, basundi mix could be classified as a cohesive material, and to have better flowability and less stickiness, this powder is recommended to be stored at {\textless} 30 °C and 40{\%} RH. This characterization will help to understand the behavior of basundi mix during processing, and will be useful in the design of handling, processing and storage equipment.},

abstract = {Liquid pressure is a key parameter for detecting and judging faults in hydraulic mechanisms, but traditional measurement methods have many deficiencies. An effective non-intrusive method using an ultrasound-based technique to measure liquid pressure in small diameter (less than 15 mm) pipelines is presented in this paper. The proposed method is based on the principle that the transmission speed of an ultrasonic wave in a Kneser liquid correlates with liquid pressure. Liquid pressure was calculated using the variation of ultrasonic propagation time in a liquid under different pressures: 0 Pa and X Pa. In this research the time difference was obtained by an electrical processing approach and was accurately measured to the nanosecond level through a high-resolution time measurement module. Because installation differences and liquid temperatures could influence the measurement accuracy, a special type of circuit called automatic gain control (AGC) circuit and a new back propagation network (BPN) model accounting for liquid temperature were employed to improve the measurement results. The corresponding pressure values were finally obtained by utilizing the relationship between time difference, transient temperature and liquid pressure. An experimental pressure measurement platform was built and the experimental results confirm that the proposed method has good measurement accuracy.},

abstract = {? 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.Utilization of long-chain alcohols (LCOH) as diet-composition markers in sheep consuming six diets composed of improved pasture species (Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens) with heather-gorse components (Erica spp., Calluna vulgaris and Ulex gallii) was evaluated. Twenty-four adult cross-bred sheep were housed in individual stalls. Diet composition was estimated from LCOH concentrations, combined or not with alkanes and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) data using least-squares procedures. Prior to calculations, faecal concentrations were corrected using mean treatment (faecal recovery 1, FR1) recoveries and mean recoveries across diets (FR2). Estimates were compared with those obtained without faecal correction (FR0) and known values. Large differences between plant species and plant parts were found in LCOH patterns and total LCOH concentrations. LCOH provided complementary information to that given by alkanes and LCFA. Even-chain LCOH comprised the largest fraction, representing on average 0?894 of total concentrations. Faecal recovery was incomplete and tended to increase with carbon-chain length (CCL) in a curvilinear manner (FR = -7?872 + 0?580 ? CCL - 0?010 ? CCL2; P {\textless}0?001; r2 = 0?752). Diet composition influenced (P {\textless}0?001) LCOH recovery, although variability within (CV of 9?0{\%}) and between (CV of 13?3{\%}) diets was low. Accuracy of estimates was influenced (P {\textless}0?001) by faecal-correction method and markers used, and the best estimate was obtained combining LCOH and alkanes. Improvement in estimate accuracy can be achieved if suitable correction of LCOH faecal concentrations is performed prior to calculations. Results indicated that LCOH showed lower dependence than alkanes and LCFA on the use of accurate faecal-correction data.},

The primary investigation centered on the synthesis of octyl-$\beta$-. d-glucopyranoside (octyl-glu, OG). OG could be synthesized through reverse hydrolysis reaction with very low efficiency. Then, OG was synthesized between BG and octanol by a transglycosylation reaction. In a 2-ml reaction system, OG was synthesized with a conversion rate of 51.1{\%} in 3 h when 5 mg/ml BG was utilized as the glucosyl donor under optimized conditions. And, even after being reused four times, the Pp-DCBGL was relatively stable. Additionally, a 500-ml-scale reaction system was conducted in a 2-L stirred reactor with a conversion rate of 47.5{\%} in 1.5 h. Moreover, the conversion rate did not decrease after the whole-cell catalyst was reused two times. In conclusion, Pp-DCBGL has high reaction efficiency and operational stability, which is a powerful biocatalyst available for industrial synthesis.},

abstract = {Online monitoring of product quality attributes using high resolution analytical tools is a prerequisite for implementation of process analytical technology (PAT) and thereby ensuring product quality and consistency. Online high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been established for real time monitoring of product quality attributes. However, requirement of liquid handling system capable of online sampling and fractionation and interfacing it with preparative scale chromatography appends to the cost and complexity of the design module of commercially available online HPLC. This paper proposes a cost-effective approach for using a traditional offline HPLC for online analysis using a 2 way/6 port valve to facilitate simultaneous automated sampling of product stream eluting from a process column and fractionation. No sample dilution is required in the proposed approach. The versatility of the proposed online configuration has been verified by demonstrating its use for two of the most common separations required during production of monoclonal antibody therapeutics: separation of aggregates and separation of charge variants. Process modeling has been performed to allow interpolation of HPLC data and facilitate pooling to achieve the desired purity (model predicted purity 99.1{\%} vs achieved purity of 99.3{\%} for removal of aggregates, model predicted main species yield of 62.4{\%} vs achieved main species of 62.9{\%} for pooling of charge variants). The study thus demonstrates that the proposed online HPLC configuration can be used for PAT applications in preparative chromatography.},

abstract = {Among several fruit seeds, apple seed was identified as a new promising $\beta$-glucosidase source for alkyl O-glucoside synthesis by reverse hydrolysis, since it showed high hydrolytic activities on a broad spectrum of $\beta$-glucosides. From the crude extract of apple seed meal, a major glucosidase isoenzyme was purified to homogeneity, with a purification factor of 47-fold and an overall yield of 12.8{\%}, by ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatographic separation through DEAE-Cellulose, Butyl-Toyopearl and Sephadex G150 columns. The purified enzyme is a homodimer; each subunit has a molecular mass of about 60 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and the pI of this $\beta$-glucosidase is about 5.7. These properties indicate that the apple seed $\beta$-glucosidase is totally different from any of the almond $\beta$-glucosidase isozymes reported so far. Furthermore, the purified enzyme of apple seed displays higher thermal stability than the commercially supplied $\beta$-glucosidase from almond, with half-lives of 42.9 h and 14.2 h, respectively, as preserved at 50 °C in an aqueous environment. The optimum pH of the apple seed $\beta$-glucosidase was 6.0 and the stable pH range was 5.0-9.0, both similar to those of the commercial almond $\beta$-glucosidase. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A mesoporous metal-organic framework (MOF) material, UMCM-1, has been synthesized and characterized using N 2 adsorption, powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared techniques. A detailed experimental study has been made of the adsorption of pure methane, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen at various temperatures (298-338 K) and pressures (up to 25 bar). Multitemperature isotherms were modeled using the Dubinin-Astakhov equation to obtain useful thermo-dynamic properties including adsorption potential characteristic curves and isosteric heats of adsorption. Results are compared with mesoporous carbons and silicas. Large-pore materials are shown to exhibit relatively high heats of adsorption for CO 2 when open metal sites are present. This phenomenon is not observed for methane, which indicates the importance of the CO 2 quadrupole in influencing binding strength. Adsorption results for N 2 and O 2 show that selectivities in MOFs can be manipulated by the presence or absence of open metal sites. UMCM-1 and MOF-177 show a slight preference for O 2 over N 2 . However, open metal site MOFs such as Cu-BTC show the opposite adsorption preference, which is similar to zeolite selectivities. This experimental study reveals interesting adsorption information about a novel mesoporous MOF within the context of other MOFs and traditional mesoporous adsorbents. These results can be used to advance the development of structure-property relationships for metal-organic frameworks.},

abstract = {Direct measurements of the pull-off (adhesion) forces between pharmaceutical particles (beclomethasone dipropionate, a peptide-type material, and lactose) with irregular geometry and rough polymeric surfaces (series of polypropylene coatings, polycarbonate, and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) were carried out using the atomic force microscope. These measurements showed that roughness of the interacting surfaces is the significant factor affecting experimentally measured pull-off forces. A broad distribution of pull-off force values was noted in the measurements, caused by a varying adhesive contact area for a particle located on rough substrate. The possibility of multiple points of contact between irregularly shaped pharmaceutical particles and substrate surfaces is demonstrated with nanoindentations of the particle in a fluoropolymer film. Force-distance curves showing the "sawtooth" pattern are additional evidence that particles make contact with substrates at more than one point. Reduced adhesion of 10- to 14-$\mu$m-diameter lactose and peptide material particles to the polypropylene coatings with a roughness of 194 nm was found in this study. Similar pull-off force versus roughness relationships are also reported for the model spherical particles, silanized glass particle with a size of 10 $\mu$m and polystyrene particle with a diameter of 9 $\mu$m, in contact with polypropylene coatings of varying roughness characteristics. It was found that the model recently proposed by Rabinovich et al. (J. Colloid Interface Sci. 232, 1-16 (2000)) closely predicts the pull-off forces for glass and lactose particles. On the other hand, the adhesion of the peptide material and polystyrene particle to polypropylene is underestimated by about an order of magnitude with the theoretical model, in which the interacting substrates are treated as rigid materials. The underestimate is attributed to the deformation of the peptide material and polystyrene particles. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {Waste cooking oil is a potential alternative of refined vegetable oil for biodiesel production due to its low cost and elimination of its disposal problem. The concentration of free fatty acids (FFAs) in WCO dictates the type of chemical treatment required for biodiesel production: a single esterification reaction is considered at high content of FFAs, whereas, a combination of estrification and transestrification reaction is used at moderate content of FFAs. In this study, optimization of esterification process of FFAs in artificially acidified soybean oil with oleic acid combined with methanol as an agent and ion exchange resin as a heterogeneous catalyst was carried out. The optimization process was performed by means of Matlab software based on a kinetic model available in the literature. Conversion of acidified oil was determined as an objective function in correlation with reaction variables i.e., temperature and catalyst weight. It is found that the maximum conversion of the free acids is 95.95{\%} which is achievable at 4.48 g catalyst loading and reaction temperature of 120°C. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

It is concluded that the degree of dilation found in these experiments is most significant. Furthermore, the experiments suggest that the material is less dense at the outlet than might be expected from the current theory. This in turn suggests that no discontinuity in the stress and velocity fields is needed to model the flow. The dilation is capable of reducing the flow so much that the challenge to the theoretician is no longer to find ways of increasing the dissipation of energy in their models but to decrease it. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

We found that lipase from C. antarctica B is particularly useful for the preparation of 6,6′-di- acylsucrose, whereas T. lanuginosus lipase catalyzes selectively the synthesis of 6-O-acylsucrose. The granulated T. lanuginosus lipase retained more than 80{\%} of its initial activity after 20 cycles of 6 h. Both lipases were similarly effective for the regioselective synthesis of 6′-O-palmitoylmaltose and 6-O-lauroylglucose. The effect of the synthesized sugar esters on the growth in liquid medium of various microorganisms (Gram-positive, Gram-negative and yeasts) was evaluated. 6-O-lauroylsucrose and 6′-O-lauroylmaltose inhibited the growth of Bacillus sp. at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml, and of Lactobacillus plantarum at 4 mg/ml. Sucrose dilaurates and 6-O-lauroylglucose did not show antimicrobial activity, probably due to their low aqueous solubility. As regards the inhibition of yeasts, none of the tested carbohydrate esters inhibited significantly the growth of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Pichia jadinii. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this study, the origins of granule content non-uniformity in the high-shear wet granulation of a model two-component pharmaceutical blend were investigated. Using acetaminophen as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and microcrystalline cellulose as the excipient, the distribution of the API across the granule size classes was measured for a range of conditions that differed in the duration of the initial dry mixing stage, the overall composition of the blend and the wet massing time. The coarse granule fractions were found to be systematically sub-potent, while the fines were enriched in the API. The extent of content non-uniformity was found to be dependent on two factors-powder segregation during dry mixing and redistribution of the API between the granule size fractions during the wet massing phase. The latter was demonstrated in an experiment where the excipient was pre-granulated, the API was added later and wet massed. The content non-uniformity in this case was comparable to that obtained when both components were present in the granulator from the beginning. With increasing wet massing time, the extent of content non-uniformity decreased, indicating that longer wet massing times might be a solution for systems with a natural tendency for component segregation.},

Bimolecular second order kinetic model based on equal transesterification opportunity for all hydroxyl groups of sucrose/ partial esters and that based on preferential transesterification of 6-OH of the glucose unit in constant volume batch reactor were developed using integral and differential methods. The dependence of selective and non-selective kinetic models on number and nature of hydroxyl groups in the sucrose were investigated. The changes in viscosity of sucrose ester solutions in DMF solvent were interpreted on the basis of solvent-ester/ ester-ester interactions, hydrogen bond density and formation of mixed partial esters.},

Before spraying, plates should be well dried in the hood of residual solvents and components.

If heating to remove these components is done, consideration should be given so that loss of components or their decomposition is avoided (by lowering the temperature or using a shorter time in the oven). Always spray any of these reagents onto plates in a well ventilated hood while wearing safety glasses. Also apply moderate amounts to the plate so it always appears dull and flat (if it looks wet, you have sprayed too much). You can always overspray to enhance the detection. When information about the results of using the visualization reagents was available, this was put under each reagent as ‘Results'. If not give, the user will have to do a few experiments to see what the results might be.

The influence of the fatty acid chain length on the microbial inhibitory properties of lactose esters was investigated in this study. Specifically, lactose monooctanoate (LMO), lactose monodecanoate (LMD), lactose monolaurate (LML) and lactose monomyristate (LMM) were synthesized and dissolved in both dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethanol. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined in growth media. LML was the most effective ester, exhibiting MIC values of {\textless}0.05 to {\textless}5 mg/ml for each Gram-positive bacteria tested (Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium KMS, Streptococcus suis, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans) and MBC values of {\textless}3 to {\textless}5 mg/ml for B. cereus, M. KMS, S. suis, and L. monocytogenes. LMD showed MIC and MBC values of {\textless}1 to {\textless}5 mg/ml for B. cereus, M. KMS, S. suis, L. monocytogenes, and E. faecalis, with greater inhibition when dissolved in ethanol. LMM showed MIC and MBC values of {\textless}1 to {\textless}5 mg/ml for B. cereus, M.

B. cereus and S. suis were the most susceptible to the lactose esters tested, while S. mutans and E. faecalis were the most resilient and no esters were effective on Escherichia coli O157:H7. This research showed that lactose esters esterified with decanoic and lauric acids exhibited greater microbial inhibitory properties than lactose esters of octanoate and myristate against Gram-positive bacteria.},

abstract = {This study evaluates methods used for granule shape characterization. The aim is to identify an optimal combination of shape factors to measure granule shape and roughness. Granules were prepared from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), $\alpha$-lactose, microfine cellulose (MFC), and dextrin, using a small-scale high-shear mixer. Granule shapes were analysed by measuring weight, by microscopic analysis, and by sedimentation analysis in olive oil. A comparison was made among (1) the aspect ratio, (2) the circularity, (3) a new projection shape factor defined in this paper, (4) the shape factor eR, (5) the radial shape factor, (6) One-Plane-Critical-Stability (OPCS), (7) the Stokes' shape factor, and (8) a new mass shape factor defined in this paper. Besides the evaluation of the shape factors, (9) a roughness factor R is defined. When the shape of granules is evaluated, there can be effects of both shape and surface roughness. The scale of scrutiny of the measurement determines whether or not a shape factor is affected by surface roughness. We chose to call a protrusion smaller than 60 $\mu$m a roughness, and a larger protrusion a shape effect. The best evaluation of granule shape is obtained when shape and roughness are described by different parameters. The aspect ratio, the mass shape factor, OPCS, eRand the radial shape factor could not significantly discriminate between some of the different shapes. The other three shape factors give distinct differences in value for all different shapes used in this study. Of these factors, Stokes' shape factor was rejected because of the high viscosity of the oil needed, which results in a significant temperature dependency. Circularity and the new projection shape factor both work very well for our granules. The combination of the roughness factor with the new projection shape factor will provide a good description of granule shape and roughness. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is found that purified sucrose fatty acid esters can be obtained only by the use of calcium chloride in an amount stoichiometrically equivalent to the amount of the potassium stearate to be removed or in a slight excess amount. Among other soaps, potassium stearate is removed more easily from the crude sucrose fatty acid esters, which shows that potassium stearate is the most suitable soap for the solvent-free synthesis of sucrose fatty acid esters. In addition, it is also found that pure sucrose fatty acid esters can be quantitatively separated into two fractions, one with high-monoester content, and the other with low-monoester content. Sucrose fatty acid esters with a wide range of HLB can be obtained by mixing the two parts in varied proportions. An equilibrium relationship between the distribution of sucrose fatty acid esters with a high HLB in liquid phase and sucrose esters with a low HLB in the precipitate is studied and a triangle graph and equations are given. According to the triangular graph and the equations, the yield of the two fractions can be predicted. {\textcopyright} Carl Hanser Publisher.},

Alkylated pectins produced interesting rheology properties. They showed higher apparent viscosities but lower intrinsic viscosities than the original one. The higher apparent viscosities may be due to intermolecular association of hydrophobic segments in the molecule. The lower intrinsic viscosities would be ascribed to more compact conformation. In addition, the modified pectins showed an enhancement of emulsifying properties. These properties were significantly influenced by the degree of substitution and alkyl chain length. Such amphiphilic derivatives open new perspectives for improving or altering viscosity and emulsifying properties of pectin.},

abstract = {'Sugar esters' are non-ionic biodegradable surfactant which are potentially attractive for the cosmetic and food market. Unfortunately, the formation of by-products by chemical synthesis affects the quality of the surfactant. Enzymatic synthesis is a promising and environmentally friendly approach preventing this problem but requiring a proper setting up of the reaction system (membrane reactor, azeotropic mixture, pervaporation system, etc.) for the control of the water activity so that the enzyme efficiency is often negatively affected. In this paper, the synthesis of glucosylmyristate by Novozym 435 is taken as a model to illustrate the general features of the 'sugar esters' synthesis, with particularly regard to the influence on the synthesis of the pre-reaction treatment of the enzyme and reaction mixture, water adsorbents, reaction solvents, products and reagents. The aim is reached by placing the water adsorbents in contact with the enzyme preparation, so that high dehydration efficiency is achieved and the other factors affecting the kinetic of the synthesis are better highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Fiberglass, aluminum and steel were used as nozzle materials. The main object of this study is to investigate thermal effect of nozzle materials and working fluids on thermal performance of the vortex tube. Experimental studies were made by using three different nozzle materials (fiberglass, aluminum and steel) with inlet pressure between 150 kPa to 700 kPa with arrange of 50 kPa increment. The fraction of cold mass was kept at 0.36 and the ratio of vortex tube (L/D) was taken 10. Also an exergy analysis was carried out for each case. This study revealed that steel as a nozzle material has the highest value of temperature gradient for air as a working fluid.},

The glass and silicon substrates were treated to render them either hydrophobic or hydrophilic. All the hydrophilic surfaces gave simple force curves and pull-off forces increasing uniformly with RH. Small contacts (R ? 20 nm) gave pull-off forces close to values predicted by simple Laplace?Kelvin theory (?20 nN), but the values with microspheres (R ? 20 ?m) fell well below predictions for sphere?flat or sphere?sphere geometry, due to roughness and asperity contacts. The hydrophobic silicon surfaces also exhibited simple behavior, with no significant RH dependence. The pull-off force again fell well below predicted values (Johnson?Kendall?Roberts contact mechanics theory) for the larger contacts. Hydrophobic glass gave similar adhesion to silicon over most of the RH range, but against both silicon tips and glass microspheres, there was an anomalously large adhesion in the RH range 20?40{\%}, accompanied by a long-range noncontact force. The adhesion on fully hydrophilic surfaces and its RH dependence can be mostly explained by current theories of capillary bridges, but the interpretation is complicated by the sensitivity of theoretical predictions to contact geometry (and hence to roughness effects) and by uncertainties in the thickness of adsorbed water layers. The anomalous behavior on hydrophobic glass surfaces at intermediate values of RH is not fully understood, but possible causes are (1) dipole layers in the partially formed water film, giving rise to patch charges and long-range forces, or (2) fixed charges at a reactive glass surface, involving specific bonding reactions.

Initial conversion rate increased as substrate solubility increased. Ester bond formation was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance technique that the chemical shifts of glucose H-6 and $\alpha$-carbon protons of fatty acids in the ester molecules shifted to the higher fields. Contact angle of water on esters' pelleted surface increased as the hydrophobicity increased. Glucose esters' and commercial sucrose esters' functionality as emulsifiers were compared. Glucose esters delayed, but did not prevent coalescence, because the oil droplets diameter doubled during 7 days. Sucrose esters prevented coalescence during 7 days since the droplets diameter did not have significant change.},

abstract = {Moderate consumption of red wine has been putatively associated with lowering the risk of developing coronary heart disease. This beneficial effect is mainly attributed to the occurrence of polyphenol compounds such as anthocyanosides (ACs), catechins, proanthocyanidins (PAs), stilbenes and other phenolics in red wine. This review focuses on the vascular effects of red wine polyphenols (RWPs), with emphasis on anthocyanosides and proanthocyanidins. From in vitro studies, the effect of red wine polyphenols on the vascular tone is thought to be due to short- and long-term mechanisms. NO-mediated vasorelaxation represents the short-term response to wine polyphenols, which exert the effect by increasing the influx of extracellular Ca2+, and the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in endothelial cells. Polyphenolic compounds may also have long-term properties, as they increase endothelial NO synthase expression acting on the promoter activity. In addition, they decrease the expression of adhesion molecules and growth factors, involved in migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Moreover, they inhibit platelet aggregation. However, a paucity of data as regards the bioavailability and metabolism of these compounds in human studies is a limiting factor to proving their efficacy in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2004 European Society of Cardiology.

abstract = {Using D-glucurono-6,3-lactone (GlcL) and sucrose (Suc) as raw materials, we synthesized sucuronic acid (SucA), in which the D-glucose (Glc) residue of Suc was replaced with D-glucuronic acid, by a three-step chemoenzymatic method. In the 1st chemical step, methyl D-glucuronate (GlcAM) was synthesized by treating GlcL with a strong base anion exchange resin, Amberlite IRA402BL OH AG, in anhydrous methanol. In the 2nd step, which included an enzyme reaction, methyl sucuronate (SucAM) was synthesized from GlcAM and fructose by exploiting the transfructosylation activity of the Microbacterium saccharophilum K-1 $\beta$-fructofuranosidase, a reaction that is suppressed in the presence of high-concentration Glc. In this reaction, the addition of a Suc-non-assimilating yeast, Saccharomyces bisporus NBRC1131, to the reaction mixture increased the amount of SucAM generated, because Glc was removed from the mixture by this yeast. In the 3rd chemical step for producing sodium sucuronate (SucA{\textperiodcentered}Na), SucAM was treated with Amberlite IRA402BL OH AG in water to hydrolyze SucAM's ester bond, and product was then treated with NaOH. The molar yield of SucA{\textperiodcentered}Na from GlcL was 34.2{\%}. SucA was stable at 37 °C in buffer solutions at pH 3, 5, 7, or 9. However, at temperatures exceeding 75 °C, the glycosidic bond of this disaccharide was hydrolyzed not only in acidic buffers (pH 3 and 5) but also in alkaline buffer (pH 9). SucA was not a suitable substrate for the $\beta$-fructofuranosidases of M. saccharopilum K-1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

abstract = {Different methods of preparing lipases for use in organic media are critically reviewed. Solid lipase preparations can be made by typical immobilisation methods such as adsorption, entrapment, covalent coupling or cross-linking. Immobilisation is especially attractive for lipases because, in addition to the normal benefits of enzyme immobilisation, it can also lead to a considerable increase in catalytic activity, probably caused by conformational changes in the lipase molecules. Activation can be achieved, for example, using hydrophobic support materials or surfactants during the immobilisation procedure. Surfactants can also be used to solubilise lipases in organic media via the formation of hydrophobic ion pairs, surfactant-coated lipase or reversed micelles. Lipase preparation methods are discussed with regard to potential lipase inactivation and activation effects, mass transfer limitations, lipase stability and other features important for applications. The practical applications of lipases in organic media reviewed include ester synthesis, modification of triacylglycerols and phospholipids, fatty acid enrichment, enantiomer resolution, biodiesel production and acylation of carbohydrates and bioactive compounds.},

abstract = {The yeast Candida bombicola produces a mixture of sophorolipids when it grows on glucose and/or oil substrates. Sophorolipids show surfactant properties that can be used in several industries such as pharmaceutical, cosmetic, etc. Maximum sophorolipid production has been achieved using a resting cells process. A good knowledge of growth conditions and medium formulation are necessary to obtain enough biomass in the sophorolipid production process. Two facts permit the study of yeast growth and sophorolipid production separately. These compounds are nongrowth-associated products. Two carbon sources for the sophorolipid synthesis are necessary. In this work, an optimization of a synthetic medium for C. bombicola growth has been achieved by factorial design and analysis of experiments. First, a design using four factors (glucose, nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium) at two levels was studied. Glucose showed different behaviors at these two levels, making it difficult to determine the influence of other nutrients. It was necessary to separately study the influence of glucose concentration using limiting nutrient experiments. Once the optimum level of glucose was determined, the quantitative composition of the synthetic medium was fixed according to the literature. A new design was made using three factors (N, P, Mg) and three levels which made it possible to observe curvature effects in the results of the analysis. It was found that magnesium had no significant influence on growth while nitrogen and phosphorus gave optimum values. Finally, the medium proposed in the literature and the optimal medium found in this work have been compared for C. bombicola growth on both orbital shakers and stirrer and sparged tank bioreactors.},

abstract = {Glucosylation of flavonoids improves their bioavaibility and pharmacological properties. An organic solvent-tolerant bacterium Staphylococcus saprophyticus CQ16 was newly isolated and was found to glucosylate daidzein. Strikingly, the polar solvent 15{\%} DMSO significantly improved the glucosylation of daidzein with 3.5 times yield, and glucosylation was further improved with the supplemental co-solvents. The most effective glucosylation of daidzein to daidzein-7-O-glucoside catalyzed by whole cells of strain CQ16 was achieved with a molar yield of 90{\%} in a system with addition of 15{\%} DMSO and 0.5{\%} butyl acetate. The conversion process produced very few by-products, and therefore simplified purification of the glycoside product. The glucosyltransferase from strain CQ16 showed broad substrate specificity to the various flavonoids as well as flavonoid analogs, nonetheless an exquisite regioselectivity of the C-7 hydroxyl group of flavonoids. It would be substantive benefits for exploiting the new candidates with higher bioavailability for pharmaceuticals.{\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Candida bombicola is able to produce sophorolipid molecules with surfactant properties when grown in a medium composed of two different carbon sources (usually sugar and oil) and a nitrogen source (frequently yeast extract). In this work, the composition of the medium and the culture method employed have been studied. The influences of glucose concentration, properties of oil and yeast extract concentration have been taken into account. Accordingly, a production medium composition is proposed (100 g/l glucose, 100 g/l sunflower oil and 1 g/l yeast extract). The most frequent culture methods reported in literature, i.e. batch, medium pulse mode and resting-cell methods, have been tested. The resting-cell method was found to produce the highest final concentration of sophorolipid, obtaining a good yield of carbon sources in a relatively short time. Under the best operational conditions and using the resting-cell method, 120 g/l sophorolipid was obtained in 8 d, with a carbon source yield of 0.60. Product distribution has also been investigated and the sophorolipid molecular structure of opened or cycled molecules has been determined under different operational conditions. Low yeast extract concentration and long fermentation time enhance the production of cycled structures by all the production methods studied.},

abstract = {This article describes the synthesis of a series of oligofructose monoesters with fatty acids of different chain length (C8, C12, C16 and C18) to obtain food-grade surfactants with a range of amphiphilicity. Reactions were performed in a mixture of DMSO/ButOH (10/90 v/v) at 60 °C and catalysed by immobilised Candida antarctica lipase B. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis showed that the crude reaction products were mixtures of unmodified oligofructose and mostly mono-esters. The conversion into mono-esters increased with the length of the fatty acid chain, reflecting the specificity of the lipase towards more lipophilic substrates. Reverse phase solid phase extraction was used to fractionate the products, which lead to sufficient purity ({\textgreater}93{\%}) of the fatty acid esters for functionality testing. It was shown that derivatives of longer (C16 and C18) fatty acids were more efficient in lowering surface tension and gave a much higher dilatational modulus than derivatives of the shorter (C8 and C12) fatty acids. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Salidroside is a natural glycoside with pharmacological activities of resisting anoxia, microwave radiation and fatigue, improving oxygen lack, and postponing ageing. In this work, salidroside and other natural glucosides such as cinnamyl O-$\beta$-d-glucopyranoside and 4-methoxybenzyl O-$\beta$-d-glucopyranoside were efficiently synthesized via an environmentally benign and energy economic process. In the synthetic process, apple seed, easily available from discards of fruit processing factories, was employed as a natural and green catalyst. Moreover, all of the catalyst, solvent and excessive substrate was reused or recycled. The biocatalytic reaction was carried out in a clean and less toxic medium of aqueous tert-butanol and the glucoside produced was selectively removed from reaction mixture by alumina column adsorption, making excessive substrate (aglycon) recyclable for a repeated use in the next batch of reaction. For improvement of the biocatalyst stability, apple seed meal was further cross-linked by glutaraldehyde, yielding a net-like porous structure within which the dissociating proteins were immobilized, resulting in improved permeability of the biocatalyst. After the simple cross-linking treatment, the half-life of apple seed catalyst was significantly improved from 29 days to 51 days. The productivity of the bioreactor in the case of salidroside can reach ca. 1.9 g l-1d-1, affording the product in up to 99.3{\%} purity after refinement. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of buffer ion strength and pH, and enzyme loading on the immobilisation yield and the enzyme activity were evaluated. Approximately 98{\%} of the protein and 33{\%} of the total activity were immobilised. At pH 5.15, the enzymatic half-life was 132 min at 60 °C and 18 min at 70 °C. The immobilised enzyme maintained 60{\%} of its initial activity after 28 days storage at 4 °C. The degree of conversion was controlled by simple regulation of the flow rate through the reactor, making it possible to optimise the product distribution. It was possible to achieve a yield of the primary coupling product n-dodecyl-(1,4)-$\beta$-maltooctaoside (C12G8$\beta$) of about 50{\%}, with a ratio between the primary and the secondary coupling product of about 10. Thermoanaerobacter sp. CGTase (Toruzyme 3.0 L) immobilised on Eupergit C had good operational stability at 60 and 70 °C thus showing the advantages of using more thermostable enzymes in biocatalysis. However, this enzyme was unsuitable for the production of C12G8$\beta$ due to extensive disproportionation reactions, giving a broad product range. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Effect of xylan concentration, enzyme dose, reaction water content, reaction temperature and initial pH on the yield of these surfactants has been studied. The optimal conditions for n-octyl xylobioside and n-octyl xylotrioside synthesis are found to be different. The maximum n-octyl xylobioside and n-octyl xylotrioside yield were 120 and 38 mg/g of xylan, respectively.

The objectives of this work were to study the effects of several surface treatments on glass and quartz using atomic force microscopy, contact angle measurements, and a novel dewpoint error technique, in order to develop a better understanding of the effects of these treatments. The dewpoint error technique was also examined as a novel method for measuring surface energy that may have advantages over contact angle measurements. Most significantly, chromic acid and oxygen/argon sputtering treatments were found to substantially decrease the contact angles of both glass and quartz. The surface roughness of glass was markedly increased by acetic acid, heated NaOH, and piranha etch while HCl and KOH caused the highest surface roughness for quartz. A reasonably good correlation was found between decreasing contact angles and increasing dewpoint error, suggesting that the dewpoint technique may provide a quantitative measure of surface energy without some of the drawbacks of contact angle measurements. There was no correlation found between surface roughness and contact angle hysteresis or dewpoint error. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Many waxes including plant waxes and animal waxes were evaluated for the gelation ability toward soy- bean oil (SBO) and compared with hydrogenated vegetable oils, petroleum waxes and commercial non-edible gelling agents to understand factors affecting the gelation ability of a gelator. Sunflower wax (SW) showed the most promising results and all SW samples from three different suppliers could make a gel with concentrations as low as 0.5 wt{\%}. Candelilla wax and rice bran wax also showed good gelation properties, which, however, varied with different suppliers. Gelation ability of a wax is significantly dependant on its purity and detailed composition. A wax ester with longer alkyl chains has significantly better gelation ability toward SBO than that with shorter alkyl chains indicating that the chain length of a component in a wax such as wax ester is an important factor for gelation ability. The SW–SBO organogel showed increased melting point with increased SW content, showing the melting point range from about 47 to 65 C with 0.5–10 wt{\%} SW. The effects of cooling rate on crystal size and firmness of a gel were investigated. The dependence of firmness on cooling rate was so significant that the desired texture of an organogel could be achieved by controlling the cooling rate in addition to controlling the amount of gelling agent. This research reveals that a small amount of food grade plant waxes including SW may replace a large amount of the hardstock containing trans-fat or saturated fat.},

abstract = {This study evaluates methods used for granule shape characterization. The aim is to identify an optimal combination of shape factors to measure granule shape and roughness. Granules were prepared from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), $\alpha$-lactose, microfine cellulose (MFC), and dextrin, using a small-scale high-shear mixer. Granule shapes were analysed by measuring weight, by microscopic analysis, and by sedimentation analysis in olive oil. A comparison was made among (1) the aspect ratio, (2) the circularity, (3) a new projection shape factor defined in this paper, (4) the shape factor eR, (5) the radial shape factor, (6) One-Plane-Critical-Stability (OPCS), (7) the Stokes' shape factor, and (8) a new mass shape factor defined in this paper. Besides the evaluation of the shape factors, (9) a roughness factor R is defined. When the shape of granules is evaluated, there can be effects of both shape and surface roughness. The scale of scrutiny of the measurement determines whether or not a shape factor is affected by surface roughness. We chose to call a protrusion smaller than 60 $\mu$m a roughness, and a larger protrusion a shape effect. The best evaluation of granule shape is obtained when shape and roughness are described by different parameters. The aspect ratio, the mass shape factor, OPCS, eRand the radial shape factor could not significantly discriminate between some of the different shapes. The other three shape factors give distinct differences in value for all different shapes used in this study. Of these factors, Stokes' shape factor was rejected because of the high viscosity of the oil needed, which results in a significant temperature dependency. Circularity and the new projection shape factor both work very well for our granules. The combination of the roughness factor with the new projection shape factor will provide a good description of granule shape and roughness. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Zwitterionic polymers have drawn significant attention for membrane-based separations due to their impressive hydrophilicity and antifouling properties. Here we demonstrated a novel synthesis method to prepare an am-phiphilic copolymer poly(arylene ether sulfone-co-sulfobetaine arylene ether sulfone) (PAES-co-SBAES), which was blended with native polysulfone (PSf) to prepare free standing membranes. The polymer chemical structures were analyzed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and the molecular weight of polymers was identified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The PSf/PAES-co-SBAES blend membranes with various zwitterionic SBAES segment contents were fabricated via the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process. The membrane composition , surface morphology (roughness), and surface hydrophilicity were determined by fourier transform in-frared (FT-IR) spectrum, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and water contact angle measurements, respectively. The cross-section morphology and surface hydrophilicity of the as-made membranes was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and water contact angle measurements, respectively. The results indicated that both the porosity of the support layer and surface hydrophilicity increased drastically due to the incorporation of hydrophilic SBAES segments. The water permeance and antifouling ability of the PSf/PAES-co-SBAES blend membranes were both remarkably improved to 2.5 L m −2 h −1 bar −1 and 94{\%} of flux recovery ratio, respectively , while salt rejection remained at a high level (98{\%}) even under the high exposure to chlorine. This work provided a valuable and scalable strategy to fabricate desalination membranes via the introduction of zwitter-ionic segments in a rigid polysulfone matrix, and we predict that additional polymer optimization will drive the performance even higher.},

Due to their unique physical properties such as the nonvolatility, thermal stability, nonexplosion, high polarity, and temperature-dependent miscibility with water, ionic liquids (ILs) have attracted considerable attention as reaction solvents and media for selective oxidations and are considered as green alternatives to volatile organic solvents.

abstract = {Sophorolipids (SLs) are known to possess antimicrobial properties towards many species (particularly Gram-positive, or Gram+) of bacteria. However, these properties can only be exerted if the SLs can be introduced to the bacterial cells in an acceptable manner. Propionibacterium acnes is the common bacterial cause of acne. It is a Gram+facultative anaerobe that is susceptible to the antimicrobial effects of SLs. In this study we demonstrated that different biopolymer matrices could be used to produce SL composite films that exert various antimicrobial efficiencies against P. acnes. Increasing SL concentrations in poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and PHB-co-10{\%}-3-hydroxyhexanoate (PHB/HHx) resulted in noticeably improved (PHB/HHx was best) antimicrobial activity based on the size of the zones of inhibition using an overlay plating technique on synthetic growth medium. However, increasing concentrations of SLs in PHB and PHB/HHx films also increased film opacity, which diminishes the appeal for use especially in visible (facial) areas. Pectin and alginate improved the transparent character of SL composite films while also acting as successful carriers of SLs to P. acnes. The lactone form of the SLs proved to exhibit the best antimicrobial action and in concert with either pectin or alginate biopolymers provided a comparatively transparent, successful means of utilizing SLs as a renewable, environmentally benign anti-acne solution. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Candida bombicola was grown using a variety of lipophilic carbon substrates. Most of the hydrocarbon and carboxylic acid substrates resulted in a mixture of sophorolipids consisting of free acids and the more desirable lactones. The ratio of diacylated lactone to free acid in these mixtures was a maximum when produced using hexadecane and heptadecane. All of the other lipophilic substrates resulted in significant amounts of free acids being produced. These lactone products were unique in that they precipitated as crystals, which were easily separated from the culture medium. All of the other products were isolated as oils as is usually reported in the literature. Finally, the amounts of these crystals recovered were significantly higher than those observed for any of the oily products. It was possible to determine the degree of direct incorporation of the lipophilic substrates into the sophorolipids for a homologous series of alkanes. The amount of direct incorporation increased with increasing chain length to a maximum for pentadecane, hexadecane and heptadecane. As the length of the alkane substrate increased further, the amount of direct incorporation then decreased until there was no apparent incorporation for eicosane. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Sucrose esters have the potential to enhance both drug solubility and drug absorption. They are therefore alternatives to the widely used glycerides in the formulation of lipid-based drug delivery systems. A simple production of aqueous nanosized drug carrier systems consisting of amphiphilic sucrose fatty acid esters using exclusively nontoxic materials has been achieved. By only using 2 wt{\%} of the emulsifier a high viscosity of the sample could be reached. Diverse history of fabrication led to the differences in the macroviscosity of SE dispersions with equal chemical composition. Combining the well-established oscillating rheology with the electron paramagnetic resonance technique, three orders of magnitude difference in macroviscosity between the dispersions containing 2 wt{\%} of the amphiphilic SE were obtained, whereas the viscosities at the molecular level were all close to the viscosity of water. Viscoelastic behaviour could also be shown for these systems. TEM experiments visualized coexisting irregular micelles and lamellar structures in the SE dispersions. The results are important to understand the complex LDDS based on amphiphilic SE. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sophorolipids (SLs) are a family of glycolipid type biosurfactants, which are largely produced by the non-pathogenic yeast, Candida bombicola. In order to investigate the possibility of SLs for industrial use, here we examined the interfacial activities, cytotoxicity and biodegradability of SLs, and compared these properties with those of two lipopeptide type biosurfactants (surfactin and arthrofactin), sodium laurate (soap, SP) and four kinds of chemically synthesized surfactants including two block-copolymer nonionic surfactants (BPs), polyoxyethylene lauryl ether (AE) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It was indicated that SLs had extremely low-foaming properties and high detergency comparable with commercially available low-foaming BPs. These interfacial activities of SLs were maintained under 100 ppm water hardness. Cytotoxicity of SLs on human keratinocytes was the same as surfactin, which has already been commercialized as cosmetic material, but higher than BPs. Moreover, biodegradability of SLs using the OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals (301C, Modified MITI Test) displayed that SLs can be classified as "readily" biodegradable chemicals, which are defined as chemicals that are degraded 60{\%} within 28 days under specified test methods. We observed 61{\%} degradation of SLs on the eighth day of cultivation. Our results indicate that SLs are low-foaming surfactants with high detergency, which also exhibit both low cytotoxicity and readily biodegradable properties. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.},

The main uses of Jojoba oil-wax are in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industry, but new uses could arise related to the search of new energetic crops. This paper summarizes a process to convert the Jojoba oil-wax to biodiesel by transesterification with methanol, catalysed with sodium methoxide (1 wt{\%} of the oil). The transesterification reaction has been carried out in an autoclave at 60°C, with a molar ratio methanol/oil 7.5:1, and vigorous stirring (600 rpm), reaching a quantitative conversion of the oil after 4 h. The separation of the fatty acid methyl esters (the fraction rich in FAME, 79{\%} FAME mixture; 21{\%} fatty alcohols; 51{\%} of methyl cis-11-eicosenoate) from the fatty alcohols rich fraction (72{\%} fatty alcohols; 28{\%} FAME mixture; 26{\%} of cis-11-eicosen-1-ol, 36{\%} of cis-13-docosen-1-ol) has been accomplished in a single crystallization step at low temperature (-18°C) from low boiling point petroleum ether. The fraction rich in FAME has a density (at 15°C), a kinematic viscosity (at 40°C), a cold filter plugging point and a high calorific value in the range of the European standard for biodiesel (EN 14214). {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These are extensively used in personal care products, pharmaceutical preparations and membrane protein research. Commercial production of these surfactants is carried out in multiple steps through Fischer glycosylation reactions under extreme conditions in the presence of toxic catalysts. $\beta$-glycosidases provide an alternative enzymatic method for their synthesis as these are easily available from microbial systems and exhibit broad substrate specificity and high stereo-selectivity. This review highlights the recent progress in glycosidase catalyzed synthesis of alkyl-glycosides. Several reaction parameters that affect the overall reaction kinetics, such as, water activity, nature of the glycosyl donor, pH of the reaction medium, reaction time, temperature and source of enzyme are discussed. Strategies available to enhance the yield, including two-phase solvent systems and immobilization are described. Current challenges and future prospects in the biological routes of synthesis are also reviewed.},

abstract = {As an extension of previous work in our laboratory, a wide‐range Pirani gauge that is capable of measuringvacuumpressure down to 10−7 Torr reproducibly has been built. The micromachined Pirani sensor used in the experiments has a suspended membrane that is supported by the nearly radiation‐limited, thermally insulating beam leads crossing over a V‐groove cavity. A method of partial dummy compensation, as proposed previously by Weng and Shie for eliminating the ambient drift, is proved here to be very effective with a thermal drift as small as only 5.7 $\mu$V/°C. It has also been found that a thermal‐stress‐induced piezoresistive effect, which has a profound influence on the limitation of measurement, appears in the constant‐bias operation wherein the sensor temperature rises with the reduction of gas pressure and therefore thermal conduction. This effect causes the irreproducibility of pressure measurements by the device below 10−5 Torr. In addition to its inherently higher sensitivity, a constant‐temperature circuit together with a thermoelectric stabilization of the sensor substrate temperature can eliminate the induced piezoresistive error. The constant‐temperature circuit operating on the micro‐Pirani sensor together with the above‐mentioned temperature compensation and the stabilization methods have extended gauge capability down to 10−7 Torr, which is only limited by the signal readout resolution (∼1 $\mu$V). This is three orders of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional vacuum gauges of the thermal conductivity type.},

abstract = {The authors attempted to synthesize carbohydrate esters of fatty acids enzymatically in order to overcome the problems associated with the chemical processes for the synthesis of commercial sucrose esters. The enzymes used were lipases from microorganisms belonging to Rhyzopus, Enterbacterium, Aspergillus, Pseudomonas, Chromobacterium, Candida, Mucor and Penicillium. Fatty acids (stearic, oleic and linoleic) and carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose, fructose and sorbitol) used for the reaction were obtained from commercial sources. The enzyme reaction was performed by mixing the enzyme and the substrates in the buffer solution and incubating at 40 C; after freeze-drying the mixture, the products were extracted and subjected to thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). It was observed by TLC and HPLC that carbohydrate esters of fatty acid were produced by the enzyme reaction, and their structures were confirmed by infra red (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometries. The lipase from Candida cylindracea was the most enzyme active on the synthesis of carbohydrate esters. The optimum conditions for its activity were as follows: molar ratio of carbohydrate to fatty acid: 0.05mol/l : 0.2mol/l; amount of lipase: 4g/l; pH of the reaction mixture: 5.4 in phosphate buffer; reaction period: 72 hr. {\textcopyright} 1984 American Oil Chemists' Society.},

abstract = {The properties of jojoba oil make it uniquely suited as a raw material for the cosmetics industry. Water-based, thermodynamically stable preparations of jojoba oil are essential in many formulations. New microemulsions were prepared based on jojoba oil and different nonionic surfactants, namely polyoxyethylene-(ethylene oxide)10-oleyl alcohol (Brij 96V) and ethoxylated sorbitan esters (Tweens). The effects of the surfactants and of primary alcohols as cosurfactants on the isotropic regions of the phase diagram were elucidated. It was found that, up to a certain cosurfactant chain length, the isotropic region expanded considerably as chain length increased. The size of the isotropic region also increased as a function of the ethylene glycol content of the aqueous phase in microernulsions based on ethoxylated alcohol but shrank when ethylene glycol was included in microemulsions prepared with ethoxylated sorbitan esters. Secondary structural phase transitions from water-in-oil to bicontinuous and to oil-in-water structures (as determined by measuring conductivity and viscosity) were found to be related to jojoba oil content. Dynamic light scattering and small angle X-ray scattering studies established that incorporation of jojoba oil into Brij 96V micelles caused micellar transformation from elongated to spherical droplets and a decrease in the aggregation number.},

Sugar esters are widely used nonionic and nontoxic biosurfactants. Certain sugar esters inhibit microbial growth and have other activities. Lipase mediated synthesis has important advantages over conventional chemical synthesis of sugar esters. Lipase catalyzed synthesis is typically carried out in organic solvents having a low water activity to drive the reaction towards synthesis instead of towards ester hydrolysis. The impact of the various reaction conditions on enzymatic synthesis of sugar esters in nonaqueous media is discussed. Considered in particular are the solvent effects; the effects of water activity; the influence of the nature and concentration of the reactants (sugars and fatty acids); the influence of temperature; and the effects associated with the specific nature of the lipase catalyst used. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The effect of incorporating new nonionic glycolipid surfactants on the properties of a model water/nonionic surfactant/oil nano-emulsion system was investigated using branched-chain alkyl glycosides: 2-hexyldecyl-. $\beta$(/. $\alpha$)-. d-glucoside (2-HDG) and 2-hexyldecyl-. $\beta$(/. $\alpha$)-. d-maltoside (2-HDM), whose structures are closely related to glycero-glycolipids. Both 2-HDG and 2-HDM have an identical hydrophobic chain (C16), but the former consists a monosaccharide glucose head group, in contrast to the latter which has a disaccharide maltose unit. Consequently, their hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) is different. The results obtained have shown that these branched-chain alkyl glycosides affect differently the stability of the nano-emulsions. Compared to the model nano-emulsion, the presence of 2-HDG reduces the oil droplet size, whereas 2-HDM modify the properties of the model nano-emulsion system in terms of its droplet size and storage time stability at high temperature. These nano-emulsions have been proven capable of encapsulating ketoprofen, showing a fast release of almost 100{\%} in 24. h. Thus, both synthetically prepared branched-chain alkyl glycosides with mono- and disaccharide sugar head groups are suitable as nano-emulsion stabilizing agents and as drug delivery systems in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study, methods of surface preparation by polishing, fiber-drawing, melt-casting and chemical etching were evaluated with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for a variety of alkali and alkaline earth aluminosilicate glasses. Freshly polished glass surfaces were exposed to a variety of chemical etch ants (NaOH, NH4 IA 114 and HF) and the resulting surface composition and morphology are reported. The polishing and etching parameters were optimized to obtain a smooth surface (root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of :::;3 nm) and a surface composition as close as possible to the bulk composition. In addition, glass melt and fiber surfaces were examined to investigate the effect of thermal processes on surface composition and morphology. It is shown that polishing can alter the surface composition of these multicomponent glasses, and that post-etching of the polished surface to expose the bulk composition is plagued by preferential leaching, contamination and/or roughening. The most significant conclusion is that there is a strong dependence of these surface compositional modifications upon the specific glass; even within specific glass systems, the polish/etch procedure must be modified to yield a surface with the bulk composition. On the other hand, the smoothness of fibers and melt-cast surfaces is ideally suited to AFM and depth profiling; their surface compositions can be close to the bulk values, but careful attention to the annealing conditions is required to achieve this.

Twenty-four adult cross-bred sheep were housed in individual stalls. Diet composition was estimated from LCOH concentrations, combined or not with alkanes and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) data using least-squares procedures. Prior to calculations, faecal concentrations were corrected using mean treatment (faecal recovery 1, FR1) recoveries and mean recoveries across diets (FR2). Estimates were compared with those obtained without faecal correction (FR0) and known values. Large differences between plant species and plant parts were found in LCOH patterns and total LCOH concentrations. LCOH provided complementary information to that given by alkanes and LCFA. Even-chain LCOH comprised the largest fraction, representing on average 0?894 of total concentrations. Faecal recovery was incomplete and tended to increase with carbon-chain length (CCL) in a curvilinear manner (FR = -7?872 + 0?580 ? CCL - 0?010 ? CCL2; P {\textless}0?001; r2 = 0?752). Diet composition influenced (P {\textless}0?001) LCOH recovery, although variability within (CV of 9?0{\%}) and between (CV of 13?3{\%}) diets was low. Accuracy of estimates was influenced (P {\textless}0?001) by faecal-correction method and markers used, and the best estimate was obtained combining LCOH and alkanes. Improvement in estimate accuracy can be achieved if suitable correction of LCOH faecal concentrations is performed prior to calculations. Results indicated that LCOH showed lower dependence than alkanes and LCFA on the use of accurate faecal-correction data.},

A kinetic study for the direct transformation of cellulose using 1-octanol has shown that depolymerisation of cellulose continues during the Fischer glycosidation. Increasing the chain length of the alcohol decreases the global reaction rate owing to an increase in the lipophilicity of the alcohol that decreases its contact with the carbohydrates. Finally, several acid catalysts were tested and the best results were obtained with Amberlyst-15Dry.},

A kinetic study for the direct transformation of cellulose using 1-octanol has shown that depolymerisation of cellulose continues during the Fischer glycosidation. Increasing the chain length of the alcohol decreases the global reaction rate owing to an increase in the lipophilicity of the alcohol that decreases its contact with the carbohydrates. Finally, several acid catalysts were tested and the best results were obtained with Amberlyst-15Dry.},

abstract = {Fluidization is sensitive to mild cohesion levels, as evidenced by the different flow behaviors of Geldart Group A and Group B particles. Additionally, cohesion is extremely sensitive to surface roughness. Here, mildly cohesive (Group A) spherical particles were carefully characterized and used in high-fidelity experiments of defluidization, bed expansion, and bubble characterization. The experiments were conducted such that van der Waals forces were the only source of cohesion, and thus the results presented can be used for validating Discrete Element Method (DEM) and/or continuum models. Particle characterization includes surface roughness and adhesion (pull-off) force, which can be used for modeling the van der Waals force. Additionally, the particle friction coefficient, coefficient of restitution, shape (sphericity), and diameter were measured via a suite of simple experiments. This level of particle characterization, which is critical for the validation of cohesive models (DEM and continuum), has not been reported in previous fluidization studies. Accordingly, the characterization experiments employed here are described in sufficient detail for straightforward adaption elsewhere.},

Innovations in this field may soon enable the development of rapid, on-site sequencing devices that significantly improve both the availability and accuracy of detailed bioinformatics. However, achieving efficient continuous-flow operation and size-based fractionation of DNA still presents considerable challenges. Current methods have not yet satisfied the need for rapid fractionation of size-heterogeneous nucleic acid samples into specific and narrow size distributions. Dielectrophoretic (DEP) mechanisms integrated in microfluidic devices offer unique advantages for such applications, including short processing times, microscale reaction volumes, and the potential for low cost and portability. To facilitate such developments, we have adapted a microfluidic constriction sorter device to separate a wide range of nucleic acid analytes into distinct microchannel outlets.

As the use of these mixtures as biodiesel have many disadvantages, the separation of JA from the FAAE was carried out. After the separation step, the main properties of transesterified jojoba oil (TJO), JA and FAAE were determined. The JA (9-octadecenol, 11-eicosenol, 13-docosenol and 15-tetracosenol), which are obtained through two-step crystallizations have many pharmaceutical applications and a high-added value as main product. From these results, it was found that after the separation of JA from FAAE some properties of the fraction rich in FAAE, has been improved regarding its corresponding TJO. In addition, when other short-chain alcohols instead of methanol were used as transesterification agents, the cold properties and oxidation stability of FAAE were improved, while the kinematic viscosity was increased.},

abstract = {Several nanotechnological solutions for mucosal immunization have been proposed, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, solid lipidic particles, micelles, and surfactant vesicles. In recent years, surfactant vesicles have gained increasing scientific attention as an alternative potential drug delivery system to the conventional liposome. This type of vesicle known as niosomes or nonionic surfactant vesicles (NSVs) has a structure and properties similar to those of liposomes. Both of them can transport hydrophilic drugs by encapsulation in the aqueous inner pool or hydrophobic drugs by intercalation into hydrophobic domains. The aim of this study was to prepare and characterize vesicles formed by sucrose esters as protective systems of bioactive molecules for oral administration. Vesicles were prepared using two commercial products formed by mixtures of mono and diesters S-570 and S-770, respectively. Determined parameters were size and zeta potential; the stability of formulations was tested in presence of increasing concentrations of a surfactant, and at several pH values observed in the gastrointestinal tract. Solubilization experiences showed an initial decrease in size for vesicles of both ester mixtures, samples showed detergent resistance at higher Triton X-100 concentrations. Vesicles showed stability at pH 5-7.4 up to 90. min; however, both formulations showed colloidal instability at pH. =. 2, which corresponds to the isoelectric point of these vesicles. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of both vesicle formulations and separately each pure ester, Caco-2 cells were used. Cytotoxic evaluation indicated that both types of vesicles and free sucrose distearate were safe for Caco-2 viability; however, free sucrose monostearate was toxic for the cells.As a conclusion of these preliminary studies, it can be stated that vesicles formed with mixtures of sucrose esters showed a size in the range of 200. nm maintaining their size when exposed to the action of a surfactant, but showing aggregation at acidic pH. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A microfluidic process for producing crystals of controlled size by confining the crystallization within drops is demonstrated. The process consists of a drop producing stage which segments the mother liquor into monodisperse drops followed by crystallization in a temperature controlled tubular crystallizer. The process is implemented to produce lactose crystals with significantly narrower crystal size distribution (CSD) as compared with crystals produced in a stirred bulk crystallizer. By controlling the drop size and initial supersaturation the mean crystal size can be controlled. The distribution of the number of crystals per drop and the CSD are measured as a function of supersaturation at temperatures between 20 and 40{\{}ring operator{\}} C for 150 and 300 $\mu$ m drops. In the case where drops contain only one crystal, a very narrow CSD is obtained with a coefficient of variation of crystal size as low as 7{\%}. The crystallization of lactose in a microfluidic tubular crystallizer is modeled by treating nucleation in drops as a Poisson process with a nucleation rate based on classical nucleation theory. Experimental results are in good agreement with predictions from a Poisson process model over the range of temperatures, supersaturations and drop sizes tested. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that corresponding to each actual heat exchanger, there is an ideal heat exchanger that is a balanced counter-flow heat exchanger. The ideal heat exchanger has the same UA, the same arith- metic mean temperature difference, and the same cold to hot fluid inlet temperature ratio. The ideal heat exchanger's heat capacity rates are equal to the minimum heat capacity rate of the actual heat exchanger. The ideal heat exchanger transfers the maximum amount of heat, equal to the product of UA and arithmetic mean temperature difference, and generates the minimum amount of entropy, making it the most efficient and least irreversible heat exchanger. The heat exchanger efficiency is defined as the ratio of the heat transferred in the actual heat exchanger to the heat that would be transferred in the ideal heat exchanger. The concept of heat exchanger efficiency provides a new way for the design and analysis of heat exchangers and heat exchanger networks.},

abstract = {The present study reports the production of mustard seed oil ethyl esters (MSOEE) through alkali-catalyzed transesterification with ethanol using potassium hydroxide as a catalyst. The influence of the process parameters such as catalyst concentration, ethanol to oil molar ratio, reaction temperature, reaction duration and the catalyst type was investigated so as to find out the optimal conditions for the transesterification process. As a result, optimum conditions for production of MSOEE were found to be: 0.90{\%} KOH wt/wt of oil, 8:1 ethanol to oil molar ratio, a reaction temperature of 60 C, and a reaction time of 60 min. Dry washing method with (2.50{\%} wt.) of the activated carbon that was produced from the de-oiled cake was used to purify the crude ethyl ester from the residual catalyst and glycerol. The transesterification process provided a yield of 94{\%} w/w of ethyl esters with an ester content of 98.22{\%} wt. under the optimum conditions. Properties of the produced ethyl esters satisfied the specifications prescribed by the ASTM standards. Blending MSOEE with petro diesel was also investigated. The results showed that the ethyl esters had a slight influence on the properties of petro diesel. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Cadmium carbonate was used as a promoter of this Koenigs-Knorr reaction, and the products were obtained in 82-92{\%} yields. Deprotection of the carbohydrate functionality of 5a/5b-12a/12b was carefully performed using ethanolysis in the presence of zinc acetate, due to the presence of another ester functionality in the aglycone part of the molecule of protected alkyl glycosides. Resulting alkyl glycosides 13a/13b-20a/20b (diastereoisomeric mixtures) and 13a-20a (enantiopure compounds), biochemically activated hormonogenic compounds (juvenogens), were obtained in 82-93{\%} yields. Finally, chiral HPLC separation of the diastereoisomeric mixtures of alkyl glycosides was applied to get sufficient quantities of the respective enantiomers 13b-20b of the alkyl glycosides for their structure elucidation and13C chemical shift assignment by1H and13C NMR spectroscopy. Partial introductory entomological screening tests of the target alkyl glycosides 13a/13b-20a/20b were performed on the red firebug (Pyrrhocoris apterus). The results of this biological testing clearly demonstrated the time-extended effect of several juvenogens on P. apterus due to their biochemical activation, i.e., hydrolysis of the juvenogen molecule, which results in liberation of the biologically active juvenoid in the insect organism. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sucrose synthase (SuSy, EC 2.4.1.13) is a glycosyltransferase (GT) long known from plants and more recently discovered in bacteria. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible transfer of a glucosyl moiety between fructose and a nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) (sucrose + NDP ↔ NDP-glucose + fructose). The equilibrium for sucrose conversion is pH dependent, and pH values between 5.5 and 7.5 promote NDP-glucose formation. The conversion of a bulk chemical to high-priced NDP-glucose in a one-step reaction provides the key aspect for industrial interest. NDP-sugars are important as such and as key intermediates for glycosylation reactions by highly selective Leloir GTs. SuSy has gained renewed interest as industrially attractive biocatalyst, due to substantial scientific progresses achieved in the last few years. These include biochemical characterization of bacterial SuSys, overproduction of recombinant SuSys, structural information useful for design of tailor-made catalysts, and development of one-pot SuSy-GT cascade reactions for production of several relevant glycosides. These advances could pave the way for the application of Leloir GTs to be used in cost-effective processes. This review provides a framework for application requirements, focusing on catalytic properties, heterologous enzyme production and reaction engineering. The potential of SuSy biocatalysis will be presented based on various biotechnological applications: NDP-sugar synthesis; sucrose analog synthesis; glycoside synthesis by SuSy-GT cascade reactions.},

Medium containing mixed hydrophilic substrate (deproteinized whey and glucose), yeast extract and oleic acid was investigated in this study for SLs production from the yeast. The produced SL was also purified and characterized in the study. At an optimum combination of the medium constituents, the yeast C. bombicola produced maximum 23.29±0.54g/l, 25.54±1.01g/l and 33.32±0.83g/l of the biosurfactant when fermentation was carried out in batch shake flasks, in bioreactor without pH control and in bioreactor with pH control, respectively. Produced SL was purified by silica gel column chromatography and was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR and LC-MS whose results revealed it to be (17-hydroxyoctadecenoic)-1'4″-lactone-6'6″-diacetate SL. Further, its critical micelle concentration and minimum surface tension against water were found to be 27.17mg/l and 34.18mN/m, respectively. Results of interfacial tension obtained using the SLs between water and either n-hexane, sunflower oil or olive oil proved its ability to solubilize non-aqueous phase liquids in water. Further, the biosurfactant was found to be stable at wide range of pHs, temperature and salt concentrations. The results of emulsifying activity and stability of the product against the tested organic solvents and oils together with its ability to solubilize fat and oil confirmed the potential of the biosurfactant in environmental applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Roughness, present at some scale for all real materials, complicates this task by introducing asperity-con trot led contact. Roughness also causes pull-off force data scatter, a well-known phenomenon that is usually neglected in analysis of the AFM pull-off results. This paper presents the first systematic study of roughness effect on the pull-off force magnitude and its distribution characteristics. The results indicate that the scatter in the data decreases with increasing diameter of the probe as compared to the dimension of surface irregularities, but the magnitude of the pull-off force is more severely altered by roughness. The results also show that when particle size is at the same scale as surface roughness, multiple contact points may be made yielding increased adhesion.},

abstract = {Traditional powder flow measurement devices, such as shear cells, operate in the quasi-static regime of shear strain rate. The FT4 powder rheometer of Freeman Technology, developed over the last two decades, has provided a clearer differentiation of powder flowability in some instances. This has been attributed to the instrument operating in the dynamic regime of shear strain rates, a feature that has yet to be established. We report an analysis of the dynamic behaviour of a bed of glass beads made cohesive by silanisation and subjected to standard FT4 testing procedure, where a rotating blade is driven into a cylindrical bed, using a combination of experimental measurements and numerical simulations by the Distinct Element Method (DEM). The DEM analysis underestimates the flow energy measured experimentally, although the agreement is improved when sliding friction is increased. The shear stress of the powder in front of the blade is shown to be roughly constant along the radial direction and increasing as the impeller penetrates the bed, suggesting that a characteristic shear stress can be determined for a powder under a given test condition in the FT4. For ease of simulations large beads were used (1.7-2.1. mm). Future work will investigate the influence of particle properties and operational conditions on the prevailing stresses and strain rates.},

The solubility of sucrose, initial formation velocities and final concentrations of 6-O- and 6′-O-stearoyl sucrose were affected by addition of polar co-solvents. Without co-solvents 6-O-stearoyl sucrose appeared as the first product followed by 6′-O-stearoyl sucrose. In the presence of polar co-solvents both regio-isomers were synthesized from the beginning of the reaction. The highest initial formation velocities of 6-O- and 6′-O-stearoyl sucrose were 26 nmol min-1and 17 nmol min-1, respectively, with a sucrose conversion of 86.7{\%} obtained with 45{\%} pyridine in 2-methyl-2-butanol. In the corresponding reaction medium with 2-methyl-2-propanol as tertiary alcohol a sucrose conversion of 86.3{\%} was achieved. In the tertiary alcohols studied the overall regio-selectivity gradually decreased by adding polar co-solvent in the following order: no co-solvent {\textgreater} 45{\%} pyridine ≥ 55{\%} pyridine {\textgreater} 20{\%} DMSO. Thus the regio-isomeric distribution expressing the steady state molar ratio of the 6-O-regio-isomer to the 6′-O-regio-isomer changed from 2:1 in absence of co-solvent to 1:1 in presence of DMSO. This change could be explained kinetically by the ratio between the initial formation velocities of the two regio-isomers, defined as the regio-isomeric ratio (R=v06-O-/v06′-O-), which changed from R = 2.2 in absence of co-solvent to R = 1.2 in presence of DMSO. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Leung2010,
abstract = {Biodiesel is a low-emissions diesel substitute fuel made from renewable resources and waste lipid. The most common way to produce biodiesel is through transesterification, especially alkali-catalyzed transesterification. When the raw materials (oils or fats) have a high percentage of free fatty acids or water, the alkali catalyst will react with the free fatty acids to form soaps. The water can hydrolyze the triglycerides into diglycerides and form more free fatty acids. Both of the above reactions are undesirable and reduce the yield of the biodiesel product. In this situation, the acidic materials should be pre-treated to inhibit the saponification reaction. This paper reviews the different approaches of reducing free fatty acids in the raw oil and refinement of crude biodiesel that are adopted in the industry. The main factors affecting the yield of biodiesel, i.e. alcohol quantity, reaction time, reaction temperature and catalyst concentration, are discussed. This paper also described other new processes of biodiesel production. For instance, the Biox co-solvent process converts triglycerides to esters through the selection of inert co-solvents that generates a one-phase oil-rich system. The non-catalytic supercritical methanol process is advantageous in terms of shorter reaction time and lesser purification steps but requires high temperature and pressure. For the in situ biodiesel process, the oilseeds are treated directly with methanol in which the catalyst has been preciously dissolved at ambient temperatures and pressure to perform the transesterification of oils in the oilseeds. This process, however, cannot handle waste cooking oils and animal fats. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Oil is one of the most important energy and raw material sources for the synthesis of synthetic polymers and chemicals worldwide. In recent years, tremendous increases of accidental and intentional oil spillage have occurred during production, transportation, and refining. Oil pollution, particularly of sea and navigable waters, has stimulated more public concern than other waste or spilt materials. Oil pollution of the sea has steadily increased with the increase in oil consumption. Oil pollution of the shore also affects marine, shore life, and vegetation. Crude oil consists of different hydrocarbons that range from light gas to heavy solids. When oil is spilled on water, the physical and chemical properties of the oil change progressively, i.e., these physicochemical changes enhance oil dissolution in seawater. This process is referred to as weathering, which includes evaporation, dissolution, dispersion, photochemical oxidation, microbial degradation, adsorption onto suspended materials, agglomeration, and so on. Spilled oil has an undesirable taste and odor, causes severe environmental damage on waterfowl, material life, and affects tourism and economy. Oil spills are a global concern due to the environmental and economical impact. Spilled oil causes immense environmental damage unless it is removed as quickly as possible. Thus, various commercial systems have been developed to control these spills, e.g., removing oil from contaminated areas by the use of booms, dispersants, skimmers, oil-water separator, or different kinds of sorbent materials. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study we report the effects of fungal metabolites isolated from cultures of the fungus Trichoderma citrinoviride ITEM 4484 on the feeding preference of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, a major pest of cereal crops. Different phagodeterrent metabolites were purified by a combination of direct and reverse phase column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography. Chemical investigations, by spectroscopic and chemical methods, led to the identification of different long chain primary alcohols (LCOHs) of the general formula R-OH, wherein R is a long, unbranched, unsubstituted, linear aliphatic group. LCOHs have been reported as components of lepidopteran pheromone blends, but their phagodeterrent effect to aphids is herein reported for the first time. The effects of LCOHs on R. padi were studied by behavioral and electrophysiological bioassays. Feeding preference tests that were carried out with winged and wingless morphs of R. padi showed that LCOHs had high phagodeterrent activity and restrained aphids from settling on treated leaves at a concentration as low as 0.15 mM (0.036 g/l). The results of different electrophysiological analyses indicated that taste receptor neurons located on the aphid tarsomeres were involved in the LCOHs perception. Behavioral assays carried out with some commercial agrochemicals, including azadirachtin A, pyrethrum and a mineral oil-based product, in combination with 1-hexadecanol, the LCOH most abundantly produced by T. citrinoviride ITEM 4484, showed that these different active principles could be applied together, resulting in a useful increase of the phagodeterrent effect. The data shown indicate that these compounds can be profitably utilized for novel applications in biotechnical control of aphid pests. Furthermore, the tested LCOHs have no chiral centers and therefore can be obtained with good yield and at low cost through chemical synthesis, as well as from natural sources.},

Effect of several parameters such as glucosyl donor concentration, enzyme units and initial water activity was studied to optimize product yield. An initial water activity interval of 0.33-0.64 was favorable and increase in total enzyme units had marginal effect on conversion yield. An empirical model was developed to describe the relationship between various parameters and octyl glucoside yield. These factors were combined in a batch replacement strategy whereby octyl-$\beta$-d-glucopyranoside was synthesized in 4h to a concentration of 30mM (9.25mg/ml) with a conversion yield of nearly 70{\%} with pNPG as a glucosyl donor. Quantitative analysis was done by a highly reproducible reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method and detection was achieved using refractive index detector. The structure of the product was confirmed by13C and1H NMR spectroscopy. Additional products like octyl diglucoside were also formed, the structure of which was confirmed by mass spectrometry. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the major reaction variables, water content, temperature and pH of the lyophilized enzyme. The optimal conditions derived from RSM (3.4{\%} water content, 43 °C and pH of 10.1) provided a high initial reaction rate of 8.66 ± 0.3. mg/ml/h which agreed with the predicted value of 8.70. mg/ml/h.

abstract = {The segregation of granular materials due to differences in particle properties occurs during a variety of handling and transport processes, such as flow from a hopper. In the present work, the discrete element method (DEM) is used to investigate segregation of granular materials during discharge from a hopper. The effects of various particle properties and hopper geometries on the segregation of a spherical, bidisperse granular material during hopper discharge are studied. Particle contacts are modeled using a soft-particle model consisting of a hysteretic spring system and sliding friction. The effects of the particle diameter ratio, density ratio, fines mass fraction, hopper wall angle, hopper cross-sectional shape, and the initial fill conditions are investigated. These computational results are compared to those from a small experimental system with the same hopper dimensions and particle properties. The use of this small-scale system permits a novel, one-to-one comparison with the DEM model predictions for the purpose of model validation. The experiments utilize bidisperse glass spheres in a small, Plexiglas cylindrical hopper that is used in the ASTM International standard test for sifting segregation. Particles are discharged from either a 'mass-flow' or 'funnel-flow' hopper design and collected transiently in equal volumes until the hopper is empty. Analysis of the weight fractions of fine and coarse particles is conducted by sieving. A comparison of the computational and experimental results provides an indication of the model's success at predicting segregation during hopper discharge and the applicability of the DEM model to other granular flow systems.},

abstract = {Particle shape has a strong influence on bulk powder flow and its associated rheology. It promotes mechanical arching and adversely affects fast feeding and dosing. We use the FT4 powder rheometer of Freeman Technology to experimentally characterise the particle flow as a function of the shear strain rate, and to predict its dynamics for rod-shape particles using the discrete element method. The results show a strong realignment of the orientation of particles in the horizontal plane as the bed is sheared by the blade motion. The flow energy required for agitating a bed of rodlike particles is much larger than that of spheres and it increases with the aspect ratio, due to a combined effect of the coordination number and excluded volume. The flowability of rodlike particles can be improved by the addition of spheres, and can be well predicted by the mathematical model developed in this work. The bulk friction coefficient of the binary mixture is a linear function of the volume fraction of its components. The flow energy correlates well with the shear stress arising in front of the blade, considering the effect of the bulk friction coefficient.},

abstract = {ConspectusIn recent years, interest in homogeneous manganese catalyst development has intensified because of the earth-abundant and nontoxic nature of this metal. Although compounds of Mn have largely been utilized for epoxidation reactions, recent efforts have revealed that Mn catalysts can mediate a broad range of reductive transformations. Low-valent Mn compounds have proven to be particularly effective for the hydrosilylation of carbonyl- and carboxylate-containing substrates, and this Account aims to highlight my research group's contributions to this field. In our initial 2014 communication, we reported that the bis(imino)pyridine-supported compound (Ph2PPrPDI)Mn mediates ketone hydrosilylation with exceptional activity under solvent-free conditions. Silanes including Ph2SiH2, (EtO)3SiH, (EtO)2MeSiH, and (EtO)Me2SiH were found to partially reduce cyclohexanone in the presence of (Ph2PPrPDI)Mn, while turnover frequencies of up to 1280 min–1 were observed using PhSiH3. This led us to evaluate the hydr...},

abstract = {The enzymic synthesis of alkyl-$\beta$-glucosides by water-immiscible alcohols was studied in stirred flasks as well as in a tubular enzymatic reactor. In the first case, direct alkylation of $\beta$-D-glucose from hexanol using immobilized $\beta$-glycosidase gave a higher conversion yield and final product concentration than that using the enzyme in its free state (yield 10 against 8{\%} mol/mol, concentration 2 against 1.6 g/l). Direct glycosylation of $\beta$-D-glucose from hexanol resulted in a higher reaction performance (yield 10{\%}) than that from octanol (yield 5{\%}). However, the two different incubation temperatures tested (37°C and 50°C), showed no significant differences concerning final product concentrations. The more interesting results were obtained by transglycosylation of methyl-1-$\beta$-glucose from hexanol, with a conversion yield of 21{\%} mol/mol (product amount 4 g/l). However, the transgalactosylation of lactose from hexanol, catalyzed by a fungal $\beta$-galactosidase, showed only a feeble reactivity. The feasibility of enzymic alkylation was also tested in a tubular enzymatic reactor; hexyl-1-$\beta$-glucoside was produced via direct glycosylation from hexanol catalyzed by free $\beta$-glycosidase with a final concentration 1.3-2.3 g/l and a yield varying between 11{\%} and 20{\%} mol/mol.

abstract = {Yeast Candida bombicola is known to produce sophorolipids from a variety of saccharic and lipidic feed-stocks. In the current study, the influence of fatty acid carbon chain length, unsaturation, source of low-cost industrial lipid feed-stocks, and nickel content in lipid feed-stocks on sophorolipid production by C. bombicola were investigated. Saturated and monounsaturated C18 fatty acid gave the highest levels of sophorolipid production while fatty acids with more than one site of unsaturation gave much lower yields. Sophorolipid production was reduced when shorter (≤C16) and longer (≥C20) fatty acids were fed. The possibility of exploiting low-cost industrial wastes or by-products for sophorolipid production by batch or fed-batch processes was investigated. Tallow fatty acid residue was the best lipid feed-stock for sophorolipid production (120 g/L, fed-batch cultures), while coconut fatty acid residue resulted in the lowest production (40 g/L, fed-batch cultures). Co-feeding coconut fatty acid residue with other feed-stocks improved its substrate value in batch cultures. C. bombicola was tolerant to nickel contamination of up to 112.5 mg/L during sophorolipid production. Nickel contaminated stearic fatty acid residue was transformed to value added sophorolipid product while nickel was sequestered primarily in biomass for safe removal and recovery. Sophorolipid product obtained from nickel contaminated lipid wastes had low nickel levels ({\textless}5 mg/L) that could allow its use in low-end consumer products and household applications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Five DEM input parameters describing particle properties: static and rolling friction coefficients, coefficient of restitution, Young's modulus and cohesion energy density (using JKR cohesion model) were explored in a matrix of simulations using Design of Simulation (DoS) principles. The impact of these parameters was assessed against two responses from the FT4 test: the basic flowability energy (BFE) and specific energy (SE). By using a combination of empirical effects and interactions analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), it was found that static and rolling friction parameters play a critical role in determining the BFE and SE of a powder, whilst cohesion energy density also plays a significant role in influencing BFE. The combination of these methods has helped deliver a roadmap to show which parameters would be effectively calibrated on an FT4.},

Yield loci (r2= 0.99) determined at preconsolidation pressures of 3.80 kPa and 5.02 kPa indicated that chopped biomass followed Mohr-Coulomb failure. Normal stress significantly affected the displacement required for shear failure, as well as the friction coefficient values for all three chopped biomass types. Displacement at shear failure ranged from 30 to 80 mm, and depended on preconsolidation pressure, normal stress, and particle size. Friction coefficient was inversely related to normal stress, and was highest for chopped corn stover. Also, chopped corn stover exhibited the highest angle of internal friction, unconfined yield strength, major consolidation strength, and cohesive strength, all of which indicated increased challenges in handling chopped corn stover. The measured angle of internal friction and cohesive strength indicated that chopped biomass cannot be handled by gravity alone. The measured angle of internal friction and cohesive strength were 43° and 0.75 kPa for chopped switchgrass; 44° and 0.49 kPa for chopped wheat straw; and 48° and 0.82 kPa for chopped corn stover. Unconfined yield strength and major consolidation strength used for characterization of bulk flow materials and design of hopper dimensions were 3.4 and 10.4 kPa for chopped switchgrass; 2.3 and 9.6 kPa for chopped wheat straw and 4.2 and 11.8 kPa for chopped corn stover.

abstract = {The n-alkanes in plant cuticular wax have been used as markers for estimating the species composition of herbivore diets, but the long-chain fatty alcohols (LCOH) of plant wax may also be useful. The objective of this research was to assess if LCOH contributed extra information to differentiate plant species, compared with n-alkanes only. We used 3 data sets consisting of n-alkane and LCOH concentrations of plant species occurring in pastures of New South Wales, Australia. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to summarise the data for n-alkane and LCOH concentrations obtained for the species in these data sets. The first 3 principal components explained 86 to 93{\%} and 75 to 99{\%} of the variance in n-alkane and LCOH concentrations, respectively. Orthogonal Procrustes Rotation (OPR) was then used to compare the results of PCA conducted with n-alkane and LCOH data, with a view to establishing whether LCOH provided discriminatory information in addition to that provided by the n-alkanes. Results of OPR indicated that this was so for all 3 data sets, and suggested that the LCOH would be useful additional markers for discriminating between plant species. We tested this by using Discriminant Analysis and cross-validation procedures in 2 data sets to distinguish between defined species groups Of C-3 grasses, C-4 grasses, clovers and Lotus spp. The discrimination between these categories and the proportion of plant species correctly classified into the defined categories was better when using n-alkanes and LCOH together, compared with alkanes alone. Our results indicate that LCOH provided additional information that could be used for distinguishing plant species as part of estimating the species composition of herbivore diets.},

abstract = {The present study portrays the investigations on the optimization of K2CO3 catalysed synthesis of sucrose-coconut fatty acids esters. Determination of HV, SV and FTIR analysis provided the understanding of the progress of transesterification as a function of temperature (120-1400C), holding period (30-150 min), catalyst concentration (1-4{\%}), sucrose to FAME molar ratio (M=0.364-6) and molecular weight of fatty acids. Bimolecular second order kinetic model based on equal transesterification opportunity for all hydroxyl groups of sucrose/ partial esters and that based on preferential transesterification of 6-OH of the glucose unit in constant volume batch reactor were developed using integral and differential methods. The dependence of selective and non-selective kinetic models on number and nature of hydroxyl groups in the sucrose were investigated. The changes in viscosity of sucrose ester solutions in DMF solvent were interpreted on the basis of solvent-ester/ ester-ester interactions, hydrogen bond density and formation of mixed partial esters.},

abstract = {Up to now, the molecular mechanism of the penetration enhancing effect of sucrose esters (SEs) on stratum corneum (SC) has not been explained in details. In this study, variety of surface sensitive techniques, including surface pressure-area ($\pi$-A) isotherms, infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), have been used to investigate interactions between SEs and SC intercellular lipids. A monolayer of the mixture of ceramide AS C18:18, stearic acid and cholesterol in the molar ratio of 1:1:0.7 on an aqueous subphase is a good model to mimic a single layer of intercellular SC lipids. The $\pi$-A isotherms of mixed monolayers and parameters derived from the curves demonstrated the interaction between nonionic surfactants such as SEs and SC lipids. With increasing SE concentration, the resultant monolayer films became more fluid and better compressible. IRRAS measurements showed that SEs disordered the acyl chains of SC lipids, and the BAM images demonstrated the modification of the domain structures in SC monolayers. Longer chain-SE has a stronger disordering effect and is better miscible with ceramides in comparison to SE with a shorter hydrophobic part. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the disordering effect of SEs on the biomimetic SC model, pointing out that small changes in the structure of surfactant may have a strong influence on a penetration enhancement of lipophilic drugs through intercellular lipids of skin.},

abstract = {Jojoba wax is a natural gum base used as a food additive in Japan, and is obtained from jojoba oil with a characteristically high melting point. Although the constituents of jojoba oil have been reported, the quality of jojoba wax used as a food additive has not yet been clarified. In order to evaluate its quality as a food additive and to obtain basic information useful for setting official standards, we investigated the constituents and their concentrations in jojoba wax. LC/MS analysis of the jojoba wax showed six peaks with [M+H]+ ions in the range from m/z 533.6 to 673.7 at intervals of m/z 28. After isolation of the components of the four main peaks by preparative LC/MS, the fatty acid and long chain alcohol moieties of the wax esters were analyzed by methanolysis and hydrolysis, followed by GC/MS. The results indicated that the main constituents in jojoba wax were various kinds of wax esters, namely eicosenyl octadecenoate (C20:1-C18:1) (1), eicosenyl eicosenoate (C20:1-C20:1) (II), docosenyl eicosenoate (C22:1-C20:1) (III), eicosenyl docosenoate (C20:1-C22:1) (IV) and tetracosenyl eiosenoate (C24:1-C20:1) (V). To confirm and quantify the wax esters in jojoba wax directly, LC/MS/MS analysis was performed. The product ions corresponding to the fatty acid moieties of the wax esters were observed, and by using the product ions derived from the protonated molecular ions of wax esters the fatty acid moieties were identified by MRM analysis. The concentrations of the wax esters I, II and III, in jojoba wax were 5.5, 21.4 and 37.8{\%}, respectively. In summary, we clarified the main constituents of jojoba wax and quantified the molecular species of the wax esters without hydrolysis by monitoring their product ions, using a LC/MS/MS system.},

abstract = {The appearance and distribution of monoester regioisomers were investigated in the virtually irreversible acylation of sucrose with the enol ester, vinyl laurate, as acyl donor catalysed by serine proteases and a metalloprotease in the hydrophilic, aprotic solvent N,N-dimethylformamide. Sucrose laurate was obtained in yields from 12 to 53{\%} after 48 h under different catalytic conditions. The serine protease ALP-901, derived from a Streptomyces sp., produced the highest yield at this reaction time, while reaction with the zinc-protease thermolysin achieved the overall highest yield (63{\%}) after 6 h, with only monoesters synthesised. The total conversion of sucrose after 48 h ranged from 19 to 96{\%}. The highest degree of conversion was observed in the reaction with thermolysin, while the reactions without protein and with ALP-901 resulted in 82{\%} and 66{\%} sucrose conversion, respectively. 2-O-Lauroyl sucrose was the most abundant monoester regioisomer synthesised and the highest concentration observed was 23.7 mM after 24 h in the thermolysin-catalysed reaction. The highest concentration of 2-O-lauroyl sucrose detected in the reaction catalysed by ALP-901 was 19.0 mM, while it was 17.0 mM the reaction without protein, both after 48 h. The detected appearance of the sucrose laurate regioisomers largely corresponded to the apparent rates of formation, and 2-O-lauroyl sucrose was among the first regioisomers to appear in all reactions. The observed sucrose laurate regioisomeric distribution after 48 h (2:3:4:6:1′:3′) was 72:5:2:1:7:14 in the reaction catalysed by ALP-901, and 74:5:2:1:7:13 in the reaction without protein. In the reaction catalysed by thermolysin the distribution was 71:5:2:-:9:13 after 6 h and 86:8:-:-:4:3 after 48 h of reaction. The esterification of sucrose with vinyl laurate without protein in the reaction mixture appeared to be catalysed in the presence of aluminosilicate molecular sieves. Non-catalytic protein in the reaction medium seemed to lower the catalytic activity of the molecular sieves. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The effect of surface roughness and shape factor on behavior of particles in flotation has been investigated. Surface roughness of various degrees was applied on spherical glass beads of -150 +106. $\mu$m by means of acid etching. The same procedure was also performed on ground glass beads of the same size interval with different shape factors. The effect of these variations on surface morphology of particles was investigated in terms of flotation recovery, contact angle, and bubble-particle attachment. An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) was used for surface roughness characterizations and a correction methodology on roughness measurements of spherical particles is proposed. A digital image analyzer was used for shape factor characterizations. It is shown that increase in surface roughness improves the flotation recovery, contact angle, and bubble attachment. Shape factor, however, was found to be more predominant in flotation and bubble attachment. This is attributed to the effect of sharp edges of ground particles which triggers the film rupture process and shortens the attachment time.},

abstract = {Introduction: We have previously demonstrated that sophorolipids, a class of easily chemoenzymatically modifiable glycolipids, possess anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Since glycolipids have been shown to have anticancer activity, we investigated the effects of sophorolipids and their derivatives against pancreatic cancer. Materials and methods: Human pancreatic carcinoma cells were treated with increasing concentrations of sophorolipid natural mixture or select derivatives (ethyl ester, methyl ester, ethyl ester monoacetate, ethyl ester diacetate, acidic sophorolipid [AS], lactonic sophorolipid diacetate [LSD]) for 24 h and assessed for cell necrosis (cytotoxicity - lactate dehydrogenase release). Controls consisted of cells treated with media or vehicle alone and sophorolipid treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results: Sophorolipids demonstrated anticancer activity against human pancreatic carcinoma cells. Natural mixture mediated consistent cytotoxicity at all doses tested (20 ± 4{\%}). However, methyl ester derivative mediated much greater levels of cytotoxicity (63 ± 5{\%}) compared with other derivatives (ethyl ester diacetate, 36 ± 6{\%}, ethyl ester monoacetate, 18 ± 7{\%}; P {\textless} 0.05). In contrast, LSD- and AS-mediated toxicity was inversely proportional with dose (LSD, 40.3{\%} at 0.5 mg/mL, 3.4{\%} at 2.0 mg/mL; AS, 49{\%} at 0.5 mg/mL, 0{\%} at 2.0 mg/mL). Sophorolipid treatment did not affect peripheral blood mononuclear cells at all doses tested. Conclusions: These results suggest that sophorolipids and select derivatives may be effective in treating human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore select derivatives may use different mechanisms toward this end. The ability to chemoenzymatically modify sophorolipids can provide effective lead compounds toward the treatment of pancreatic cancer. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The two key steps of this synthesis were the conversion of oleyl aldehyde to a monounsaturated epoxide using Matteson's method followed by hydrolytic kinetic resolution and a nucleophilic epoxide opening by 2,3-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide in anhydrous DMF, which appeared to be a good reagent for this purpose. Furthermore, the diol by-product of the HKR process was also easily converted back to the starting epoxide thus almost doubling the amount of target molecule. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The nutrient intakes of mammalian herbivores depend on the amount and the nutrient content of the plant species and plant parts which they eat. We review the merits of oesophageal-fistulated (OF) animals, microhistological procedures, stable C-isotope discrimination and plant cuticular-wax markers as methods for estimating diet composition and intake in both ruminant and non-ruminant herbivores. We also briefly discuss methods based on grazing behaviour measurements or on H2O or Na turnover, and methods for estimating supplement or soil intake. Estimates of intake in ruminants are often based on separate measurements of faecal output and herbage digestibility. We review this approach and emphasize that, under some circumstances, the applicability of in vitro digestibility estimates based on OF extrusa is questionable. We discuss how plant-wax marker patterns can be used to check whether OF and test animals are consuming similar diets, but also emphasize that a major advantage of the use of plant-wax markers is that this approach may obviate altogether the need for OF animals. Estimates of total herbage intake can be partitioned into the intakes coming from different plant species and/or parts, provided diet composition can be measured. Diet composition estimates based on C-isotope discrimination have the major disadvantage that they cannot be taken to species level. By contrast, microhistological methods can identify many plant species in extrusa, digesta or faeces, but often a large proportion of plant fragments remains unidentifiable. Plant-wax hydrocarbons show great promise as markers for estimating diet composition and intake. However, we suggest that to be applicable in complex plant communities there is a need with this method either to recruit a wider range of wax markers (e.g. alcohols, sterols, fatty acids) or to use it in combination with other methods. We suggest that, in turn, this generates an urgent need for research on statistical aspects of the combined use of markers or methods, in relation to the error structures of the data or methods being combined and the standard errors of the resultant estimates of diet composition and intake. We conclude by discussing the extension of intake and/or diet composition measurements to the measurement of nutrient transactions within the gut, particularly in relation to the supply of absorbable nutrients.},

Their thermotropic liquid crystalline properties were investigated using polarizing microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that the shorter carbon chain analogues gave the smectic A phase while the longer ones gave only the columnar phase.

abstract = {This paper compares powder flowability measurements using the two methodologies available from a Freeman FT4 Powder Rheometer. The twisted blade method is empirical and measures the energy needed to establish dynamic or three dimensional flow patterns at specific packing conditions. The other is an automated shear cell in which the powder sample is sheared across a single plane to determine its shear strength properties. Six different powders were evaluated to determine their flow performance when consolidated, conditioned and aerated or fluidised. Objectives were to correlate the data from the two methods and assess the sensitivity to some of the key variables that affect powder flow properties. The results showed that dynamic testing that produces shear without compacting the powder sample (upwards testing), provides data that correlates well with shear cell data. However the standard downward dynamic test that does compact, correlates less well but was highly differentiating. It is apparent that shear strength is only one component relating to flowability and that the measured flow energy is also dependent on the compressibility of the powder and the flow rate. Shear testing of conditioned powders at near zero normal stress used the position control mode rather than force control used for the standard shear tests. Aerated powders could not be evaluated with the shear cell, but were assessed using the dynamic methodology and showed very significant differences of flow energy. In conclusion, both methodologies provide useful insights into flow behaviour with good repeatability of measurement, but dynamic data provides better differentiation between powders with similar rheological properties in all packing states. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper systematic investigations on the adsorptive drying of primary alcohols from methanol to 1-hexanol on 3A and 4A zeolites are presented. The focus of the work is laid on the superdrying of these polar solvents in the ppmw-region. In addition to equilibrium data gained in shaker bottle experiments information regarding the dynamic drying behavior was obtained by breakthrough experiments. The water content in these experiments was monitored online by a transmission photometer. Based on the experimental data a physical model was developed in order to predict the dynamic drying behavior in a fixed bed adsorber. Most of the investigated systems could be well described by this model. Furthermore pore diffusivities of water could be obtained by fitting the model to the experimental data. The results of this study reveal a clear dependency of the dynamic drying behavior of primary alcohols from the solvent to be dried and the type of zeolite. Small alcohol molecules show significantly faster drying rates than long-chain alcohols and the drying kinetics on a 3A zeolite is much faster than on a 4A zeolite. The experimental results were correlated to the molecular dimensions of adsorptives and the size of the pore openings of the zeolites as well as to the interactions between adsorptive, solvent and adsorbent.},

Several parameters such as the amount and structure of two cationic surfactants (dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) and a non-ionic surfactant (??-hydroxydodecyl ether of inulin (EC12)) as well as the amount and epoxide chain length (C6-C18/26) on the reaction efficiency (RE) were examined through NMR analysis. We can state that the etherification of inulin in aqueous media with 1,2-dodecylepoxide was dependent on the surfactant used. The non-ionic surfactant, EC12, did not have any effect on the etherification reaction. On the contrary, adding a cationic surfactant such as CTAB or DTAB increased the RE significantly. The effect of DTAB micelles on this reaction could be attributed to both electrostatic (inulin/DTAB) and hydrophobic (epoxide/DTAB) interactions. A micellar catalysis mechanism is proposed to explain these interactions. Efficiencies did not increase more than 50{\%} and were not related to variations in the epoxide alkyl chain. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Water-based, thermodynamically stable preparations of jojoba oil are essential in many formulations. New microemulsions were prepared based on jojoba oil and different nonionic surfactants, namely polyoxyethylene-(ethylene oxide)10-oleyl alcohol (Brij 96V) and ethoxylated sorbitan esters (Tweens). The effects of the surfactants and of primary alcohols as cosurfactants on the isotropic regions of the phase diagram were elucidated. It was found that, up to a certain cosurfactant chain length, the isotropic region expanded considerably as chain length increased. The size of the isotropic region also increased as a function of the ethylene glycol content of the aqueous phase in microernulsions based on ethoxylated alcohol but shrank when ethylene glycol was included in microemulsions prepared with ethoxylated sorbitan esters. Secondary structural phase transitions from water-in-oil to bicontinuous and to oil-in-water structures (as determined by measuring conductivity and viscosity) were found to be related to jojoba oil content. Dynamic light scattering and small angle X-ray scattering studies established that incorporation of jojoba oil into Brij 96V micelles caused micellar transformation from elongated to spherical droplets and a decrease in the aggregation number.},

abstract = {An array of ten $\beta$-D-glucopyranosides with varied alkyl chain lengths were enzymatically synthesized. It was found that for longer alkyl chains a lower initial rate and final yield of glucoside was obtained except for methyl glucoside because of the severe toxicity of methanol to the enzyme. From a thermodynamics point of view, the equilibrium constant and Gibbs free energy variation of the glucoside syntheses were systematically investigated. To improve the final yields of the glucosides containing long alkyl chains the equilibrium of the enzymatic glucoside synthesis was altered. The equilibrium yield of decyl $\beta$-D-glucoside increased from 1.9{\%} to 6.1{\%} when the water content was reduced from 10{\%} to 5{\%} (v/v) using tert-butanol as a cosolvent and 0.10 mol/L of glucose as a substrate. As for the other longer alkyl chain glucosides, heptyl $\beta$-D-glucoside was found to have significant surface activity as well.},

abstract = {The lipases from Thermomyces lanuginosus (immobilized by granulation with silica) and Candida antarctica B (adsorbed on Lewatit, "Novozym 435") were comparatively assayed for the synthesis of sugar esters by transesterification of sugars with fatty acid vinyl esters in 2-methyl-2-butanol:dimethylsulfoxide mixtures. We found that lipase from C. antarctica B is particularly useful for the preparation of 6,6′-di- acylsucrose, whereas T. lanuginosus lipase catalyzes selectively the synthesis of 6-O-acylsucrose. The granulated T. lanuginosus lipase retained more than 80{\%} of its initial activity after 20 cycles of 6 h. Both lipases were similarly effective for the regioselective synthesis of 6′-O-palmitoylmaltose and 6-O-lauroylglucose. The effect of the synthesized sugar esters on the growth in liquid medium of various microorganisms (Gram-positive, Gram-negative and yeasts) was evaluated. 6-O-lauroylsucrose and 6′-O-lauroylmaltose inhibited the growth of Bacillus sp. at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml, and of Lactobacillus plantarum at 4 mg/ml. Sucrose dilaurates and 6-O-lauroylglucose did not show antimicrobial activity, probably due to their low aqueous solubility. As regards the inhibition of yeasts, none of the tested carbohydrate esters inhibited significantly the growth of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Pichia jadinii. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The paper addresses a vitally important issue of precise determination of the angle of repose of granular materials. For calculation of the said angle, a photogrammetric 3D coordinate measurement method has been proposed. With the view of method verification, 600 independent measurement results were obtained, based on which the angle of repose of examined plant granular materials (triticale) was determined with a statement of the associated measurement uncertainty. The conducted analysis has shown that the proposed method is useful and capable of low (as for biological materials) measurement uncertainty congruent with the requirements of automated systems, and as such may be helpful in laying down the standard specification for measuring of the angle of repose, using coordinate metrology.},

abstract = {The novel whole-cell biocatalyst Candida antarctica lipase B displaying- Pichia pastoris (Pp-CALB) is characterized by its low preparation cost and could be an alternative to the commercial immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB). This study addresses the feasibility of using Pp-CALB in large scale glucose fatty acid esters production. 1,2-O-Isopropylidene-$\alpha$- d-glucofuranose (IpGlc) was used as the acyl acceptor to overcome the low solubility of glucose in an organic solvent and to avoid the addition of toxic co-solvents. IpGlc significantly improved the Pp-CALB catalyzing esterification efficiency when using long chain fatty acids as the acyl donor. Under the preferred operating conditions (50. °C, 40. g/L molecular sieve dosage and 200. rpm mixing intensity), 60.5{\%} of IpGlc converted to 6-O-myristate-1, 2-O-isopropylidene-$\alpha$- d-glucofuranose (C14-IpGlc) after a 96-h reaction in a 2-L stirred reactor. In a 5-L pilot scale test, Pp-CALB also showed a similar substrate conversion rate of 55.4{\%} and excellent operational stability. After C14-IpGlc was collected, 70{\%} trifluoroacetic acid was adopted to hydrolyze C14-IpGlc to myristate glucose ester (C14-Glc) with a high yield of 95.3{\%}. In conclusion, Pp-CALB is a powerful biocatalyst available for industrial synthesis, and this study describes an applicable and economical process for the large scale production of myristate glucose ester.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter summarizes crystal growth, final finish machining, precision cleaning, and defect inspection of a substrate by using a semiconductor silicon single crystal destined for an LSI as an example. The engineering methods for producing a single crystal are broadly classified into two types: the Czochralski (CZ) method and the Floating Zone (FZ) method. Both involve careful solidification of molten silicon, which has been previously made from heated polycrystalline silicon. A round rod or square pillar of single crystal silicon, called a seed crystal, is prepared. This is brought down into the molten silicon and, soon after it touches the surface, the interface instantly solidifies. The molten silicon that is contacted solidifies as a single crystal. Current wire saws can cut up to four ingots simultaneously from four sides of the web; a vast improvement in productivity over the inner diameter (ID) saw. Since the wire is so thin, the kerf loss in the wire saw cutting process is minimal.},

abstract = {The properties of sensing surfaces are particularly important in chemical and biosensing since they affect the adhesion of sensing films and the sorption of analyte molecules onto the active area of the sensor. The objectives of this work were to study the effects of several surface treatments on glass and quartz using atomic force microscopy, contact angle measurements, and a novel dewpoint error technique, in order to develop a better understanding of the effects of these treatments. The dewpoint error technique was also examined as a novel method for measuring surface energy that may have advantages over contact angle measurements. Most significantly, chromic acid and oxygen/argon sputtering treatments were found to substantially decrease the contact angles of both glass and quartz. The surface roughness of glass was markedly increased by acetic acid, heated NaOH, and piranha etch while HCl and KOH caused the highest surface roughness for quartz. A reasonably good correlation was found between decreasing contact angles and increasing dewpoint error, suggesting that the dewpoint technique may provide a quantitative measure of surface energy without some of the drawbacks of contact angle measurements. There was no correlation found between surface roughness and contact angle hysteresis or dewpoint error. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

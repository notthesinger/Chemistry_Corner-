# What the data should look like
26.3, 563.4, 123.3, 123.3, 458.2, 989.3
# Each data point is a value that is to the tenths place
# My goal is to be able to export the data to python or matlab so that I can do some stuff with it
# 	but as you can see there is no commas seperating the data point so MATLABs and pythons normal 
#       text readers can't deciper it. 
#       You are the best andrew and don't spend much time on this you got bigger fish to fry.
